Enhance the existing card component with a **subtle, premium 3D hover effect** that feels **metallic, realistic, and high-end**, without becoming flashy or overwhelming.

### Core Visual Goal

When the user hovers over the card, it should feel as if the card **lifts slightly from the surface**, revealing a **soft metallic glow along its edges**, similar to brushed metal catching light. The effect should communicate **precision, power, and technical sophistication**, not gaming or neon aesthetics.

### Hover Interaction & 3D Behavior

* On hover, apply a **very subtle 3D tilt** based on cursor position (X/Y axis rotation limited to a few degrees).
* Add a **gentle elevation** (translateY + enhanced shadow) to suggest physical depth.
* Motion must be **smooth, slow, and inertial** — no snapping or aggressive transitions.
* Use easing that feels “weighty” and premium (ease-out cubic or spring-like damping).

### Metallic Glow Effect

* Introduce a **soft edge glow** that appears only on hover:

  * Thin, diffused glow around the card border
  * Low opacity, slightly blurred
  * Color derived from the existing brand blue / cyan tones
* The glow should feel like **reflected light**, not an outline.
* Avoid neon saturation — think **polished metal under studio lighting**, not RGB.

### Lighting & Depth Details

* Add a faint **inner highlight** near the top edge to reinforce the illusion of thickness.
* Shadows should remain soft and realistic, expanding slightly on hover.
* Do NOT use hard borders; rely on gradients, glow, and shadow instead.

### UX & Restraint Rules

* The effect should activate **only on hover**, never idle.
* No continuous animation — the card must rest calmly when untouched.
* The effect should enhance discoverability, not distract from content.
* Performance must remain smooth across devices.

### Psychological Impact

The user should subconsciously feel:

* “This is engineered, not decorative.”
* “This product is serious, premium, and thoughtfully designed.”
* “Interacting with this feels precise and intentional.”

### Final Validation

If the effect draws attention away from the text, it is too strong.
If the effect feels playful or flashy, reduce intensity.
If the card feels like a real object with subtle light and depth — it’s correct.
