Focus on actionable product ideas that could generate revenue if implemented.

Participants must provide structured submissions with a clear template.

Submission Template Example (required):

Feature Name

Problem Statement / Pain Point

Proposed Solution (short description)

Target Audience (e.g., enterprise users, startups)

Expected Monetization Impact (how it could generate revenue)

Implementation Outline (technical approach, dependencies)

Optional Prototype / Mockup (Figma, screenshot, or link)

Duration: 2–3 weeks
Judging Criteria:

Innovation & originality

Feasibility for Cortex Linux

Potential monetization impact

Completeness of submission (using template)

Phase 2 — Cortex Hackathon (Code-First)

Goal: Builders implement actual features, plugins, or integrations based on Cortex IDEathon ideas or original submissions.

Structure:

Phase	Duration	Focus	Prize / Reward
Build Sprint	4–6 weeks	Develop features/plugins/integrations	Cash + swag
Demo Week	1–2 weeks	Submit video demos, community voting	Bonus pool
Merge & Ship	2–3 weeks	PR reviews, merges, potential maintainer roles	Recognition / badges

Key updates:

Encourages actual code contributions to Cortex Linux.

Generates GitHub activity, demos, and social proof.

2️⃣ Branding & Communication

Phase 1: Cortex IDEathon → emphasizes ideation & innovation.

Phase 2: Cortex Hackathon → emphasizes building and contribution.

UX / Marketing Tip:

Add a countdown timer and progress tracker for each phase on the website.

Include disclaimer about no guaranteed prize if submissions do not meet criteria.

Privacy notice: participant emails will be collected for communication and updates only.

Include moderation clause for inappropriate submissions.

Ensure compliance with local laws for competitions (especially for cash prizes).

5️⃣ Website Implementation

Phase timeline with progress indicator

Downloadable PDF button (PDF with all rules & expectations)

Submission links (Phase 1 form, Phase 2 GitHub / demo links)

Countdown to next phase

Optional: featured submissions carousel for top IDEathon ideas

6️⃣ Roadmap / Tasks to Complete

Define Phase 1 template → finalize fields & examples.

Update hackathon page copy → brand IDEathon vs Hackathon.

Create downloadable PDF → professional layout, rules, legal, and branding.

Website integration → PDF download button, timeline, progress tracker.

Email registration & tracking → ensure all participants are captured.

Internal review → legal check of IP, prize rules, and conduct policy.

Launch Phase 1 → communicate IDEathon branding & instructions.

Collect submissions → review using template.

Launch Phase 2 → start Hackathon with code-first approach.

Track participation & metrics → GitHub contributions, demo links, engagement.

✅ This approach ensures:

Phase 1 focuses on monetizable feature ideas, not marketing.

Phase 2 drives actual code contributions and GitHub activity.

Both phases are clearly branded and structured.

Participants understand expectations clearly, legally and organizationally.
