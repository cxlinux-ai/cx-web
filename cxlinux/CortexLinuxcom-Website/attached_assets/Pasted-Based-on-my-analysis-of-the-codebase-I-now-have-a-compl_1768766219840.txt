Based on my analysis of the codebase, I now have a complete understanding of the current animation patterns and enhancement opportunities. Let me create a comprehensive plan for elevating the website with world-class animations and interactive elements.

Enhancement Plan: World-Class Animations & Interactions
Current State Analysis:
Framer Motion is used for basic fade-in/slide-in animations
Hackathon page already has some advanced sections (PhaseCinematicDeck, BuilderPack with glass panels)
Most sections use simple whileInView transitions
Missing: parallax effects, magnetic interactions, scroll-linked animations, polished micro-interactions
Phase 1: Global Animation System & Utilities
Create reusable animation primitives that can be applied consistently across the site

Create animation config file (client/src/lib/animations.ts)

Standardized spring/easing presets for consistency
Reusable animation variants (fadeUp, fadeIn, stagger, scaleIn)
Scroll-linked animation hooks
Enhanced CSS utilities (client/src/index.css)

Smooth parallax utility classes
Magnetic hover effects
Glow/pulse animations
Motion blur transitions
Phase 2: Homepage Enhancements
Hero Section Upgrade

Add parallax depth layers to background elements
Magnetic cursor effect on CTA buttons
Staggered kinetic typography on headlines
Floating particle/grid background animation
Features Section Enhancement

3D card tilt on hover (perspective transform)
Icon micro-animations on hover
Staggered reveal with scroll
Stats Section Polish

Smooth count-up with easing curves
Subtle pulse on completion
Parallax offset on scroll
How It Works / Demo Section

Step-by-step reveal animations
Connection line animations between steps
Interactive terminal with typing effect enhancements
Phase 3: Hackathon Page Transformations
Journey Rail Enhancement

Horizontal scroll-linked progress indicator
Smooth momentum scrolling
Active section highlighting with smooth transitions
Build Tracks Section (What Will You Build?)

Isometric 3D card presentation
Parallax depth on scroll
Hover reveal with smooth morph animations
Track icons with subtle floating animation
Phase Cards Enhancement

Smooth accordion-style expansions
Prize reveal animations
Progress bar animations with spring physics
FAQ Section Polish

Smooth height transitions (not just rotate icon)
Staggered reveal on scroll
Subtle background shift on expand
Phase 4: Sitewide Micro-Interactions
Button Enhancements

Magnetic hover effect (subtle pull toward cursor)
Ripple effect on click
Loading state with smooth spinner
Navigation Improvements

Smooth scroll with easing
Active section indicator animation
Mobile menu with smooth slide transitions
Footer & Secondary Pages

Subtle link hover animations
Social icons with bounce/pulse on hover
Technical Approach:
Performance-first: Use will-change, GPU-accelerated transforms, useReducedMotion checks
Accessibility: Respect prefers-reduced-motion media query
Consistency: All animations use shared timing/easing from config file
Progressive enhancement: Core content works without animations
