You are a senior security-focused SaaS engineer and platform architect with experience shipping developer tools used by global enterprises.

Your task is to **add a dedicated “Security & Reliability” section (or page)** that meets the expectations of **enterprise, security-conscious, and compliance-aware teams**.

This section is **not marketing**. It is **reassurance**.

---

## Objectives

* Establish Cortex Linux as **security-first by design**
* Reassure global companies, platform engineers, and DevOps teams
* Clearly communicate architectural principles, even where features are still evolving
* Use precise, calm, technically credible language
* Avoid hype, buzzwords, or unverifiable claims

---

## Placement

Choose ONE of the following (both are acceptable):

1. A **dedicated page**: `/security` or `/security-and-reliability`
2. A **standalone homepage section** with a clear CTA to “View Security Details”

The content must be easy to find from the footer.

---

## Required Structure (Must Follow)

### Section Title

Use a professional, trust-oriented title such as:

* **Security & Reliability by Design**
* **Built with Security and Operational Reliability in Mind**

No emojis in the heading.

---

### 1️⃣ Security-First Design

Introduce this section with a short, grounded paragraph explaining that security is an architectural principle, not an afterthought.

Then list the following clearly:

* **Principle of least privilege**
  Components operate with only the permissions strictly required to function.

* **No root by default**
  Operations avoid elevated privileges unless explicitly required and user-approved.

* **Reproducible builds**
  Builds are designed to be deterministic, allowing verification and repeatability.

If a feature is not fully implemented yet:

* Clearly imply roadmap intent without overpromising
* Use wording like “designed to”, “built around”, or “aims to support”

---

### 2️⃣ Supply Chain Protection

Add a concise explanation of why supply chain integrity matters for modern developer tooling.

Then include:

* **Verified sources**
  Dependencies are resolved from trusted, auditable sources.

* **Checksums & integrity validation**
  Artifacts are validated to detect tampering or corruption.

* **Sandboxed execution**
  Commands and install processes are isolated to reduce blast radius.

Avoid claiming formal certifications unless they exist.

---

### 3️⃣ Operational Reliability

Frame this as predictability and control — not uptime bragging.

Include:

* **Deterministic installs**
  The same inputs produce the same outputs across environments.

* **Version pinning**
  Explicit version resolution to prevent unexpected breaking changes.

* **Safe rollbacks**
  Ability to revert changes when deployments or installs fail.

If rollbacks are not fully automated yet:

* Frame as “supported workflows” or “planned mechanisms”

---

## Tone & Copy Rules (Very Important)

* Calm, precise, professional
* No emojis inside the content
* No exaggerated guarantees
* No claims of “military-grade”, “bank-level”, or “unhackable”
* Prefer architectural intent over marketing language

This should read like something a **security engineer would trust**, not a landing page headline.

---

## Visual & UX Guidelines

* Clean layout, generous spacing
* Use subtle icons only if they reinforce clarity
* No flashy animations
* Emphasize readability and hierarchy
* Mobile-friendly and accessible

---

## Optional (Strongly Recommended)

End the section or page with a short transparency note such as:

* “Security is an ongoing process. We believe in transparency and continuous improvement.”
* Optional link to GitHub or future security disclosures page

---

## Final Validation Checklist

Before finishing, confirm that:

* Nothing is misleading or unverifiable
* The content reassures without overselling
* The section would pass a basic enterprise security review
* It feels appropriate for a global developer platform

Implement this cleanly and professionally.
