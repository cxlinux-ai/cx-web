You are a senior UX writer, front-end developer, and enterprise content strategist for a global SaaS platform. Your task is to create a dedicated “Beginner / Getting Started” page for Cortex Linux that is approachable, authoritative, and integrates seamlessly with the existing website design, UX, blog system, and homepage.

Goals

Make Cortex Linux accessible to beginners, students, and non-expert users.

Reinforce the enterprise credibility of the platform.

Maintain internationalization readiness (even if English-only).

Follow the existing site visual system:

Gradient text

Glass-morphism cards

Blue glow accents

Consistent typography and spacing

Responsive design

Integrate educational blog posts as part of the learning journey for beginners.

Add a small homepage preview / reference to this page to encourage onboarding without overwhelming users.

Core Content Structure
1️⃣ Hero / Intro Section

Headline: “Getting Started with Cortex Linux”

Subheadline: “Step-by-step guidance for students, new developers, and curious explorers.”

Mission line: Optionally repeat the “Why Cortex” statement: “Cortex turns natural language into deterministic Linux systems — without sacrificing control.”

CTA: “Start Your First Workflow” (primary), optionally “View Beginner Resources” (secondary)

Visuals: Optional illustration or icon cards representing learning, coding, AI, or Linux workflows.

2️⃣ “Why Cortex for Beginners”

Short paragraph in calm, authoritative tone:

Avoid buzzwords, hype, or slang

Emphasize accessibility, clarity, and control

Explain what Cortex does in plain language and why beginners can start quickly.

Include icons or visual callouts for key benefits:

Easy setup

Deterministic workflows

Step-by-step guidance

3️⃣ Quick Start Guide

List 3–5 beginner-friendly steps with short descriptions and optional CLI examples:

Install Cortex

Run a simple workflow

Verify output

Explore sample configurations

Access beginner resources via the blog

Include copy that reassures beginners, e.g., “No prior AI or Linux experience required”

4️⃣ Beginner Blog Post Integration

Include a card or grid layout linking to specific blog posts designed for beginners.

Each card should include:

Post title

Excerpt in plain language

Read time

Category/tag (e.g., “Getting Started”, “Linux Basics”, “AI Workflows”)

Thumbnail or minimal icon

Hover effect consistent with site design (glass morphism + blue glow)

When a card is clicked, redirect users to the full blog post without losing the beginner-friendly navigation context.

Blog posts themselves should follow these guidelines:

Step-by-step, actionable instructions

Minimal jargon; define any technical terms

Include screenshots, diagrams, or animated GIFs where helpful

CTA at the end of each post: “Try it yourself” linking back to Cortex workflows or Quick Start steps

SEO-friendly headings, meta descriptions, and structured data

5️⃣ Homepage Preview Section (Non-Overwhelming)

Small, visually distinct card or spotlight area on the homepage:

Headline: “New to Cortex?”

Description: “Explore our Beginner / Getting Started guide with tutorials, walkthroughs, and blog posts designed for new developers and students.”

CTA Button: “Start Learning”

Optional small icon or illustration hinting at learning or guidance

Maintain glass-morphism card, gradient text, and blue glow accents consistent with homepage

Placement:

After hero and “Built For” sections or near blog preview

Keep visually smaller than main CTAs to avoid cognitive overload

Interaction: Clicking the preview takes users to the full Beginner page, maintaining smooth scroll behavior and navigation context.

6️⃣ Use Cases by Audience

ML Engineers → GPU drivers, PyTorch workflows

DevOps → Reproducible infrastructure, CI/CD

Startups → Rapid iteration, low infra debt

Enterprises → Auditability, SLA-ready

Students → Experimentation, learning Linux automation

Use cards with gradient headers and hover effects, consistent with the homepage “Built for” section.

7️⃣ Community & Help

List available support channels for beginners:

Discord

GitHub Issues

Documentation

FAQ

Optional: Highlight average response times or “community-first” support ethos.

8️⃣ CTA / Next Steps

Strong, clear primary CTA: “Start Building”

Secondary CTA: “Explore Beginner Tutorials / Blog”

Place prominently at the bottom of the page.

UX & Design Requirements

Maintain responsive design: mobile-first, tablet, desktop, wide layouts

Use glass-morphism cards, gradient text, blue glow accents, and subtle animation consistent with the homepage

Use consistent icons for step-by-step guidance, audience cards, blog posts, and homepage preview

Ensure readability and accessibility:

High contrast text

Clear spacing

Screen reader-friendly headings

Smooth motion animation for staggered fade-in or hover effects

Smooth scroll to top when navigating to a blog, section within the beginner page, or from homepage preview

Internationalization Readiness

Neutral date formats

No slang or region-specific idioms

Consistent terminology

Optional language switcher placeholder (“EN”)

Tone & Copy Rules

Calm, confident, authoritative

Avoid hype, exaggeration, or buzzwords

Short, declarative sentences

Preserve technical accuracy

Reassure without overpromising

Implementation Notes

Page should be linked from the homepage navigation, blog sidebar, and optionally legal/FAQ pages

Homepage includes small preview card linking to beginner page

Reuse existing Footer component across all pages

Integrate smooth scroll behavior for in-page links and redirection to blog posts

Ensure SEO-friendly headings and meta tags

Optional: Add interactive code snippet cards for Quick Start steps

Blog post cards and Quick Start guides should be dynamic: automatically pull titles, excerpts, and tags from the blog CMS
