1️⃣ Card Design / Layout

Use clean, uniform cards for each press item.

White or slightly off-white background with subtle shadow.

Rounded corners (6–12px radius) for a modern look.

Consistent padding and spacing between cards.

Grid layout for desktop, stacked for mobile.

2–3 columns on wide screens.

1 column on mobile for readability.

Include:

Featured image / logo of the media outlet (if allowed legally)

Publication date

Short summary (2–3 lines)

Optional “Read More” link.

2️⃣ Typography

Headline: Use a slightly larger, bold font (e.g., 18–20px for H2 within card)

Summary: Regular weight, 14–16px, line height 1.5–1.6 for readability.

Date / metadata: Smaller, muted color (e.g., gray-400) to separate from content hierarchy.

3️⃣ Visual Cues

Subtle hover effect on cards:

Slight lift or shadow increase.

Slight color tint or border glow on hover.

Divider lines between sections to create separation.

Consistent spacing: margin between cards and sections.

4️⃣ Hierarchy & Readability

Page H1: “Cortex Linux News & Press” — clear and concise.

Card H2: Title of press item.

Summary paragraph: 1–2 sentences explaining what’s important about this article.

Avoid long blocks of text — journalists and readers scan.

Optional: highlight keywords or notable coverage using bold.

5️⃣ Structured Data & SEO

Include FAQPage schema if applicable (for press Q&A).

Use NewsArticle / Article schema for each press item:

headline, description, author, datePublished, image, url.

Helps Google show rich snippets with publication date, author, and image.

6️⃣ Social Proof / Branding

Add media logos (small, grayscale or muted) for credibility.

Include GitHub / contributors / award badges subtly in page footer or sidebar.

7️⃣ Optional Enhancements

Featured press section at the top for the most prestigious or recent coverage.

Carousel / slider for top 3–5 press items (if you want interactivity).

Tag filters: “AI, Linux, Hackathon, Open Source” to allow users to browse by topic.
