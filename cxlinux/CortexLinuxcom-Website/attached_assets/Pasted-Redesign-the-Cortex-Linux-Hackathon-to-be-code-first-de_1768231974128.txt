Redesign the Cortex Linux Hackathon to be **code-first, developer-centric, and growth-driven**, replacing the current monetization-heavy Phase 1 structure.

This hackathon should **optimize for builders who become long-term contributors and advocates**, not idea-only participants or business consultants.

---

## 1️⃣ Core Problem to Fix (Context)

The current Phase 1 structure:

* Overweights **monetization (40%)**
* Attracts **idea people instead of coders**
* Produces **low GitHub activity**
* Generates **no SEO, no PR, no lasting community value**

This filters **out** your best developers.

The most successful hackathons (including Sahil’s 300K win) are **BUILD competitions**, not pitch competitions.

---

## 2️⃣ New Hackathon Philosophy

**Principle:**

> *Code is the currency. Shipping is the signal.*

The hackathon must:

* Require installation and usage of Cortex
* Produce real GitHub PRs
* Generate demos, videos, and technical content
* Turn participants into contributors, not spectators

---

## 3️⃣ Recommended Structure: Code-First Hackathon

Replace the current structure with the following phases:

### Phase 1 — Onboarding (Weeks 1–2)

**Goal:** Eliminate non-builders early

Requirements:

* Install Cortex Linux
* Complete a guided tutorial
* Join Discord / GitHub discussions

Rewards:

* Digital certificates
* Limited swag
* Early contributor badge

---

### Phase 2 — Build Sprint (Weeks 3–8)

**Goal:** Ship real things

Participants must build:

* A Cortex feature
* A plugin / extension
* An integration (CLI, infra, AI tool, etc.)

Judging focuses on:

* Code quality
* Usefulness
* Architectural thinking
* Documentation clarity

Prize Pool: **$4,000**

---

### Phase 3 — Demo Week (Weeks 9–10)

**Goal:** Visibility + social proof

Requirements:

* Short demo video
* Public GitHub repo or PR
* Community voting + maintainer review

Bonus Pool: **$1,000**

---

### Phase 4 — Merge & Ship (Weeks 11–13)

**Goal:** Convert builders into maintainers

Activities:

* Code reviews
* PR merges
* Maintainer onboarding

Rewards:

* Maintainer roles
* Public recognition
* Long-term influence over Cortex roadmap

---

## 4️⃣ Traffic & Growth Strategy (Organic, High-Signal)

Prioritize **developer ecosystems**, not paid ads:

* DEV.to / Hashnode technical posts
* r/linux, r/selfhosted, r/homelab
* Product Hunt launch framed as a *build hackathon*
* YouTube creators doing Cortex install + build walkthroughs

Expected organic reach: **100K–200K** with <$1K spend.

---

## 5️⃣ Sahil (Suyash) as Champion Ambassador

Position Sahil as the **face of the hackathon**, not just a judge.

Leverage:

* His **300K hackathon win**
* His Smart India Hackathon credibility
* His technical background
* His India developer network

Use messaging such as:

> *“Judged and mentored by one of India’s top hackathon champions.”*

Roles:

* Champion Ambassador
* Live coding streams during the hackathon
* Social proof anchor for press and community trust

His story is more compelling than prize money — use it.

## 6️⃣ Desired Outcome

This hackathon should:

* Increase GitHub stars, forks, and PRs
* Generate long-tail SEO through demos and blog posts
* Build a real contributor pipeline
* Establish Cortex Linux as a serious, builder-first platform

Optimize for **long-term ecosystem value**, not short-term signups.
