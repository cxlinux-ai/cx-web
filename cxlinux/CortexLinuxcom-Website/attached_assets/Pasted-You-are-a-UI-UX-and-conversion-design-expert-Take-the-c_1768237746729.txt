You are a UI/UX and conversion design expert. Take the current Cortex Linux mission page and make it visually professional, modern, and highly readable, while keeping it developer-focused. Use psychology, copywriting, and marketing principles to improve clarity, engagement, and credibility without feeling corporate or marketing-heavy.

Design Goals:

Hierarchy & Readability:
– Hero headline and subheadline should clearly communicate Cortex’s mission in 2–3 lines.
– Use visual hierarchy with headings, subheadings, and spacing to guide eye movement.
– Font: clean, developer-friendly, consistent across sections.

Content Sections:
– “Why Cortex Exists”: concise mission, human-focused explanation, calm tone.
– “AI as Infrastructure”: visually differentiate this section; emphasize value proposition.
– Add subtle visual separators or cards for each principle without heavy borders.

Visuals & UI Effects:
– Subtle 3D or shadow effects on highlighted sections to draw attention without distraction.
– Use icons or illustrations (e.g., AI, terminal, infrastructure) to reinforce ideas.
– Responsive design: scales gracefully on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Trust & Credibility Signals:
– Include minimal “Built by Real People” callout here or link to trust section.
– Use GitHub avatars or contributor count icons subtly.

Copywriting & Psychology:
– Reduce cognitive load; break text into digestible paragraphs.
– Emphasize benefits, not features.
– Use active, confident, human language.

CTA / Navigation Integration:
– Include a subtle link or button to “Get Started” or “Explore Features” without overwhelming content.
– Ensure clear next step for the user.

Accessibility & SEO:
– Semantic HTML (<section>, <article>, <header>, <h1>–<h3>).
– Alt text for any illustrations/icons.
– Maintain color contrast for readability.

Deliverables:
– Updated page design with mockups or CSS/React component improvements.
– Suggested typography, spacing, and color palette.
– Optional micro-interactions (hover, subtle animation) to highlight key points.
– Structured HTML/React ready for integration.
– Improved clarity, credibility, and user focus on Cortex’s mission.”
