Animated Accents

Gradient shift: Use a slow-moving gradient line on top or edges:

background: linear-gradient(90deg, #6b5bff, #00cfff, #6b5bff);
animation: gradientShift 10s infinite;


This creates a premium tech feel without flashing or distraction.

Micro-motion hover: Buttons, badges, or the title can have a gentle scale or glow animation on hover.

3. Highlighting Key Info

Hackathon badge pulse: Make the small “Hackathon · Feb 11, 2026” badge subtly pulse or glow to guide attention.

Gradient for “Cortex”: You already use this, but ensure it matches other title gradients, creating continuity.

4. Soft Background Layers

Ambient blur / soft gradient behind content: A faint, blurred gradient or radial light behind the card draws attention subtly.

Inner ambient glow: A very soft vertical glow from the top of the card gives a layered depth.

5. Micro-Interactions

Countdown timer: Already implemented, but you can add tiny hover effects on each number:

Slight scale increase on hover.

Glow behind numbers on hover.

CTA buttons: Add hover ripple or shadow pop for subtle reward feeling.

6. Visual Hierarchy & Spacing

Increase padding & breathing room — don’t cram elements.

Make the headline bigger than the badge and secondary text smaller, subtle contrast.

Use rounded corners consistently, maybe slightly larger radius for a softer, premium look.

7. Color & Subtle Motion

Subtle motion blur / easing on scroll: As the card enters viewport, gently slide or fade in.

Use low-saturation complementary gradients for borders or glow layers. Avoid overly bright neon.

8. Typography Refinements

Headline: Bold, slightly larger (you already have 50px)

Body: Light gray, slightly increased line-height for readability

CTA text: Bold, high contrast to stand out, use subtle gradient if aligned with branding

9. Optional “Disruptive but Elegant” Touch

Slight skew or rotation of the ambient gradient layer (not the text) gives a subtle modern tech edge.

Animated “pulse” behind card to catch peripheral vision without screaming for attention.
