Hackathon Assessment

Will it drive traffic? Yes, but the current Phase 1 structure (40% monetization weighting) filters for business consultants, not developers. You want builders who become users and advocates.

The Problem with Phase 1 Monetization Focus

|Issue                            |Impact                               |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
|Attracts “idea people” not coders|Low conversion to actual contributors|
|40% monetization weight          |Filters OUT your best developers     |
|$850 prize pool for ideas        |Attracts low-effort submissions      |
|No code = no GitHub activity     |Zero SEO/social proof benefit        |

Sahil’s 300K hackathon win was a BUILD competition. That’s the model that works.

Traffic Drivers That Actually Work

|Tactic                          |Expected Reach            |Cost    |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------|--------|
|Sahil as “Champion Ambassador”  |50K+ (India dev community)|$0      |

Sahil’s Role (Maximum Leverage)

|Asset                |How to Use                                |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
|300K hackathon win   |“Judged by India’s top hackathon champion”|
|Camel story          |Viral hook for social/PR                  |
|Technical credibility|Live coding streams during hackathon      |
|India network        |Direct outreach to dev communities        |

Make Sahil the face of the hackathon. His story is more compelling than prize money.
