I found the real data. The repository has 25 stars and 47 forks. Let me update the website with these real numbers and fix the GitHub integration.

Now let me update the frontend hardcoded values as well:

I've updated all the placeholder values with the real data from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/cortexlinux/Cortex):

Changes made:

Location	Before	After
Nav bar stars	1.2k	25
Hero trust badge	1,250 stars	25 stars
Stats section stars	1,250	25
Stats section forks	340	47
Stats section contributors	89	5
Startup page forks	19,000+ clones	47 GitHub Forks
Startup page contributors	89	5
Backend fallback data	Stars: 1250, Forks: 340	Stars: 25, Forks: 47
All displayed statistics now reflect the real numbers from your GitHub repository. The site will show these values as fallbacks, and will fetch live data when a GitHub token is configured.
