You are designing and refining the **Cortex Hackathon experience** (hackathon page + homepage preview).
Your objective is not decoration — it is **maximum participation through clarity, desire, and trust**.

This hackathon must feel **important, exciting, and inevitable** to the right audience, without being loud or overwhelming.

---

## Core Goal

Turn passive visitors into **motivated participants**.

Anyone landing on:

* the homepage hackathon preview
* or the hackathon page itself

should quickly think:

> “This looks serious. This looks well designed. I want to be part of this.”

## Psychological & Marketing Foundation (Why This Must Work)

Apply these principles intentionally:

* **Attention Interruption (Without Aggression)**
  The hackathon preview must break visual routine *just enough* to pull attention — without clashing with the site’s design language.

* **Clarity Creates Trust**
  Confusion kills conversion.
  Users must immediately understand:

  * What this is
  * When it happens
  * What they do
  * Where they go next (GitHub)

* **Low Cognitive Load**
  Fewer words. Strong hierarchy. Clear actions.
  Never overwhelm.

* **Authority & Legitimacy**
  This should feel like a real, serious hackathon — not a gimmick or experiment.

* **Momentum Over Persuasion**
  Don’t “convince.”
  Make participation feel like the natural next step.

## Hackathon Preview Card (Homepage / Global Sections)

Purpose: **Interrupt → Signal importance → Redirect**

Design intent:

* Premium, clean, confident
* Visually distinct but still aligned with Cortex branding
* Clearly more important than secondary sections on the page

Must include:

* A small but visible subheader indicating the hackathon + date
* A strong, concise headline
* One short value-oriented sentence (what builders gain)
* **Two CTAs only**:

  1. Participate on GitHub (primary)
  2. Learn more (secondary → hackathon page)

Interactions:

* Smooth hover elevation
* Subtle glow or focus effect
* CTA interaction must feel rewarding and intentional

When clicked:

* The redirect to the hackathon page must feel **premium**
* Smooth scroll, easing, optional motion blur
* Always scroll to the top
* Perfectly optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile

---

## Hackathon Page (Main Experience)

This page must feel like **an invitation to build something meaningful**, not a wall of information.

Structure the experience so the user flows naturally:

1. **Immediate Context**

   * What the hackathon is
   * Why it exists
   * Why now

2. **Participation Clarity**

   * How it works (high-level, simple)
   * Where it happens (GitHub)
   * What participants actually do

3. **Motivation Without Hype**

   * Focus on learning, impact, contribution, visibility
   * Avoid exaggerated claims or pressure tactics

4. **Action**

   * Clear, repeated CTAs leading to GitHub
   * CTAs should feel like joining a movement, not filling a form

---

## Copywriting Rules (Non-Negotiable)

* Human, confident, calm
* Short sentences
* Strong verbs
* No buzzwords unless they add clarity
* Never exaggerate
* Never manipulate

Bad:
“Join the most revolutionary hackathon ever created”

Good:
“Build real AI tools for Linux. Ship code that matters.”

---

## UI & Responsiveness Expectations

* Works perfectly on **desktop, tablet, and mobile**
* No cramped text on mobile
* No excessive animation
* Motion is used to guide attention, not show off
* Every element must justify its existence

If something does not increase:

* understanding
* motivation
* or action

it should be removed.

---

## Final Success Criteria

This hackathon experience is successful if:

* Users instantly understand it
* Users feel it’s serious and well designed
* Users know exactly how to participate
* Users are naturally guided to GitHub
* Nothing feels forced, noisy, or confusing

Design and write with restraint, intelligence, and intent.
