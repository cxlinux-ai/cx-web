make sure each blog post has a unique, high-quality image that visually represents its content, either generated or sourced from free/public sources. That’s an important step for both SEO and user engagement.

Here’s a structured check and next steps for your current blog posts:

1️⃣ Blog Post Content Quality Check

Criteria for usefulness and non-repetitiveness:

Distinct topics:

Each blog post should cover a unique Linux task, tutorial, or concept.

Avoid multiple posts on the same command, permissions, or CLI workflow unless it adds a completely new angle.

Actionable content:

Readers should be able to learn something practical: commands, troubleshooting tips, best practices, or Cortex AI usage.

Depth vs. readability:

Enough depth to be useful to intermediate/advanced users.

Clear formatting: headings, code blocks, step-by-step instructions.

SEO considerations:

Primary keyword for each post, naturally integrated in title, meta description, and headings.

Use internal links to other posts or tutorials for cross-linking.

Avoid repetition:

Each post should not rehash content from other posts unless it references it with added value.

2️⃣ Images / Visual Representation

Goals for images:

Unique per post: No duplicates across the blog.

Relevant: Clearly represents the content — e.g., Docker, terminal screenshot, file permissions, code snippet, AI usage.

High quality: Minimum 1080px width for clarity; optimized for fast loading (WebP/AVIF).

Optional enhancements: Add subtle overlays, highlights, or mockups (like fake terminal outputs) to match Cortex branding.

Sources / Methods:

AI-generated images: Midjourney, DALL·E, or open-source alternatives for highly specific, unique visuals.

Free public images: Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay — check licensing.

Custom screenshots: Run commands, tools, or Cortex AI solutions, capture clean screenshots, optionally annotate.

3️⃣ Next Steps to Ensure Blog Quality

Audit each post:

Check that the topic is distinct.

Check meta title, meta description, headings, and primary keyword.

Verify that the content is actionable and non-repetitive.

Assign a unique image to each post:

Either generate an AI image specific to the post content.

Or select a public/free image that clearly represents the topic.

Optimize image size for fast loading.

Optional improvements:

Add a short intro paragraph that frames the problem clearly.

Add a “Cortex way” code snippet or demo for applicable posts.

Add 3–5 FAQ items per post to improve SEO with FAQ schema.
