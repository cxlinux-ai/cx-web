1️⃣ Technical Foundations (Non-Negotiable)

Why: Search engines can’t rank a site they can’t crawl or understand.

Clean HTML structure

One <h1> per page, hierarchically use <h2> and <h3>

Semantic tags (<article>, <section>, <nav>, <footer>)

Mobile-first design

Google uses mobile-first indexing

Pages must be responsive with readable text and tappable buttons

Fast page speed

Optimize images and assets (e.g., WebP, lazy-loading)

Minimize JS/CSS bundle size

Use caching and CDN

HTTPS everywhere

Secure your site — Google and users expect it

Clean URLs

/hackathon instead of /page?id=123

Keywords in URLs if meaningful

Sitemap & robots.txt

Submit XML sitemap to Google Search Console

Block private/duplicate pages in robots.txt

2️⃣ Metadata & Page Titles

Why: Titles and meta descriptions are the first thing users see in search results.

Title tag

One per page, unique, < 60 characters

Include primary keyword naturally

Match page intent (e.g., /hackathon → “Cortex Linux AI Hackathon | Build System-Level AI”)

Meta description

140–160 characters

Persuasive + descriptive + keyword included

Use marketing psychology: hint at benefit, urgency, exclusivity

Open Graph & Twitter Cards

Social-friendly preview (image, title, description)

Ensures shares look professional

3️⃣ Headings & Content Hierarchy

Why: Search engines read headings to understand page structure; humans scan headings first.

H1 → H2 → H3 structure

One H1 per page describing the main topic

H2 for sections, H3 for subsections

Include semantic keywords in headings

Use variations of primary keywords naturally

Avoid stuffing: it should read like a human copywriting guide

Hero section H1

Must immediately communicate value & uniqueness

Include the main keyword + benefit

4️⃣ Content Optimization

Why: SEO is not just technical — content determines rankings and conversions.

Keyword research & mapping

Primary keyword for each page

Secondary/semantic keywords naturally scattered

Focus on intent (informational, transactional, navigational)

Copywriting & psychology

Use clarity, not jargon

Answer the user’s question within first 100–150 words

Include social proof and trust signals (open-source, contributor count)

Unique content

No duplicated text across pages

Each page must target a unique concept

Internal linking

Link to related pages contextually

Use descriptive anchor text

Helps Google understand site hierarchy

Media optimization

Alt text for images: describe image + include relevant keyword naturally

Compress images without losing quality

5️⃣ UX & Engagement Signals

Why: Google’s algorithm increasingly considers user behavior.

Page speed & smooth interaction

Fast load, smooth hover, intuitive animations (like your 3D card effects)

Easy navigation

Logical nav menu: “Get Started, Security, News, AI Agencies, Hackathon”

Breadcrumbs for hierarchy

Readable layout

Short paragraphs, headings, bullet points

High contrast, good spacing

Actionable CTAs

Encourage clicks but avoid spammy wording

Each page should have one clear primary goal

6️⃣ Structured Data & Schema

Why: Helps search engines understand your pages and improves SERP appearance.

FAQ schema

If you have FAQ pages, wrap Q&A in FAQPage schema

Article / News schema

For press releases, blog posts, hackathon announcements

Organization schema

Logo, social links, founder, address (optional for credibility)

Breadcrumb schema

Helps Google show navigation path

7️⃣ Backlinks & Social Proof

Why: Off-page signals are critical for ranking and trust.

Earn real backlinks

Open-source projects: GitHub, developer blogs, technical communities

Press mentions from relevant AI/tech media

Social signals

Open Graph + Twitter cards

Share buttons with clean images and headlines

Show numbers credibly

GitHub stars, forks, contributors

Hackathon participants

8️⃣ Analytics, Monitoring & Iteration

Why: SEO is never “done”.

Google Search Console

Track impressions, clicks, index coverage

Google Analytics / GA4

Monitor engagement, bounce rate, conversions

Heatmaps (Hotjar / Microsoft Clarity)

Check if people are scrolling or missing important info

A/B test headlines & hero copy

Optimized copy converts better + may improve dwell time

9️⃣ Continuous Content Strategy

Why: Fresh content keeps the site relevant.

Blog posts

Topic clusters around Linux, AI tooling, system-level innovation

Press releases & hackathons

Each event is a fresh indexed page

Update existing content

Keep stats current (stars, contributors, events, releases)

Internal linking to new content

Push users deeper into your ecosystem

🔟 Red Flags to Avoid

Duplicate content across pages

Hidden text or invisible SEO tricks

Keyword stuffing

Auto-generated or low-quality blog posts

Overloading pages with images or heavy scripts that slow loading
