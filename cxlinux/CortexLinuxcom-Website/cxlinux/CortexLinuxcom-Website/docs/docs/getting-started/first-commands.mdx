# First Commands

Now that Cortex is installed and configured, let's explore what you can do with it. This guide covers practical commands organized by category.

## How Cortex Interprets Commands

Cortex uses AI to understand your intent and translate it into shell commands. You don't need to use exact syntax - just describe what you want to accomplish.

These commands all do the same thing:

```bash
cortex "install git"
cortex "I need git installed"
cortex "set up git on this machine"
cortex "get me git"
```

## System Information Commands

### Check System Status

```bash
# Get an overview of your system
cortex "show me system information"
```

**Output:**

```
Suggested command:
  uname -a && lsb_release -a && hostnamectl

System Information:
  Linux workstation 6.5.0-14-generic #14-Ubuntu SMP x86_64 GNU/Linux
  Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)
  Static hostname: workstation
```

### Resource Monitoring

```bash
# Check memory usage
cortex "how much RAM is being used"

# Check disk space
cortex "show disk space on all drives"

# Check CPU usage
cortex "what's using the CPU right now"
```

### Process Management

```bash
# Find resource-heavy processes
cortex "show top 10 processes by memory usage"

# Find a specific process
cortex "is nginx running"

# Kill a process
cortex "stop the process using port 3000"
```

## Package Management

Cortex automatically detects your package manager and adapts commands accordingly.

### Installing Packages

```bash
# Single package
cortex "install neovim"

# Multiple packages
cortex "install nodejs npm and yarn"

# With specific version
cortex "install python 3.11"
```

### Updating Packages

```bash
# Update package lists
cortex "check for available updates"

# Update everything
cortex "update all installed packages"

# Update specific package
cortex "update docker to the latest version"
```

### Searching and Querying

```bash
# Search for packages
cortex "search for packages related to image editing"

# Check if package is installed
cortex "is vim installed"

# Get package info
cortex "show information about the nginx package"
```

### Removing Packages

```bash
# Remove package
cortex "remove apache2"

# Remove with dependencies
cortex "completely remove mysql including config files"
```

:::warning
Removal commands will ask for confirmation before executing. Use `--dry-run` to preview what would be removed.

## File and Directory Operations

### Finding Files

```bash
# Find by name
cortex "find all .env files in this project"

# Find by size
cortex "find files larger than 1GB"

# Find by date
cortex "show files modified in the last hour"

# Find by content
cortex "search for TODO comments in all python files"
```

### Disk Usage

```bash
# Check directory sizes
cortex "what's using space in my home directory"

# Find largest files
cortex "show the 10 largest files on this drive"

# Clean up
cortex "find and remove all node_modules directories"
```

### File Operations

```bash
# Bulk rename
cortex "rename all .jpeg files to .jpg in this folder"

# Organize files
cortex "move all PDFs to a documents folder"

# Archive
cortex "create a compressed backup of /etc"
```

## Network Commands

### Network Information

```bash
# Show network configuration
cortex "display all network interfaces and IPs"

# Check connectivity
cortex "test connection to google.com"

# DNS lookup
cortex "what's the IP address of github.com"
```

### Port Management

```bash
# List open ports
cortex "show all listening ports"

# Check specific port
cortex "what process is using port 8080"

# Open firewall port
cortex "allow incoming traffic on port 443"
```

### Network Diagnostics

```bash
# Trace route
cortex "trace route to cloudflare.com"

# Check bandwidth
cortex "test internet speed"

# Monitor connections
cortex "show active network connections"
```

## Service Management

### systemd Services

```bash
# Check service status
cortex "is docker running"

# Start/stop services
cortex "restart nginx"
cortex "stop postgresql"

# Enable on boot
cortex "make redis start automatically on boot"

# View logs
cortex "show last 50 lines of nginx logs"
```

### Multiple Services

```bash
# Start a stack
cortex "start nginx, postgresql, and redis"

# Check all failed services
cortex "show all failed systemd services"
```

## User and Permission Commands

### User Management

```bash
# Create user
cortex "create a new user called deploy"

# Add to group
cortex "add user deploy to the docker group"

# Check user info
cortex "show groups for current user"
```

### Permissions

```bash
# Change ownership
cortex "make www-data own the /var/www directory"

# Fix permissions
cortex "set standard web permissions on /var/www/html"

# Find permission issues
cortex "find files in /var/www that aren't owned by www-data"
```

## Development Environment

### Git Operations

```bash
# Status and info
cortex "show git status with branch info"

# Clean up
cortex "remove all merged branches except main"

# History
cortex "show commits from last week"
```

### Development Tools

```bash
# Set up environments
cortex "install python development tools"

# Configure tools
cortex "set up docker for non-root usage"

# Build tools
cortex "install build essentials for compiling software"
```

## Combining Commands

You can describe complex multi-step operations:

```bash
# Setup a web server
cortex "install nginx, enable it to start on boot, and open port 80"

# Development setup
cortex "install nodejs, npm, and then globally install typescript and eslint"

# Backup and rotate
cortex "backup /etc/nginx to /backups and keep only the last 5 backups"
```

## Tips for Effective Commands

### Be Specific When Needed

```bash
# Vague - might not get what you want
cortex "clean up disk"

# Specific - clearer intent
cortex "remove apt cache and old kernel versions to free disk space"
```

### Use Context

```bash
# Cortex considers your current directory
cd /var/www/myapp
cortex "show recent error logs"  # Knows to look for app logs
```

### Ask for Explanations

```bash
# Get more context about what a command does
cortex --verbose "set up fail2ban"
```

### Preview First

```bash
# Always preview complex operations
cortex --dry-run "clean up docker and remove unused images"
```
