# Natural Language Commands

Cortex Linux understands your intent, not just syntax. This guide covers how to communicate effectively with the AI to accomplish system tasks.

## How It Works

When you type a command, Cortex:

1. **Parses your intent** - Understanding what you want to accomplish
2. **Maps to actions** - Translating to specific system operations
3. **Validates safety** - Checking for potential issues
4. **Executes or previews** - Running or showing what would happen

```bash
# Your input
cortex "install a web server for development"

# Cortex understands:
# Intent: Install web server
# Context: Development (not production)
# Action: Install appropriate package (nginx/apache)
# Mode: User's default (execute or dry-run)
```

## Writing Effective Commands

### Be Specific About Your Goal

The more context you provide, the better Cortex can help.

```bash
# ❌ Vague
cortex "set up python"

# ✅ Specific
cortex "install python 3.11 with pip and virtualenv for web development"
```

### Include Context When Helpful

```bash
# Context helps Cortex make better choices
cortex "I'm setting up a Django project, install what I need"

# Cortex will install:
# - Python 3.x
# - pip
# - virtualenv
# - Common Django dependencies
```

### Use Natural Phrasing

You don't need to sound like a robot. These all work:

```bash
cortex "give me nodejs"
cortex "I need nodejs installed"
cortex "install nodejs please"
cortex "set up nodejs on this machine"
```

## Command Patterns

### Installation Requests

```bash
# Basic installation
cortex "install docker"

# Specific versions
cortex "install nodejs version 18"

# Multiple packages
cortex "install git, vim, and tmux"

# With dependencies
cortex "install postgresql with all client tools"

# Development setups
cortex "set up a complete rust development environment"
```

### System Configuration

```bash
# Service management
cortex "start the nginx service and enable it on boot"

# User management
cortex "create a new user called deploy with sudo access"

# Network configuration
cortex "configure the firewall to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic"

# File permissions
cortex "make the /var/www directory writable by the web server"
```

### Information Queries

```bash
# Package information
cortex "what version of python is installed?"

# System status
cortex "show me disk usage for all mounted drives"

# Service status
cortex "is nginx running? show me its status"

# Finding things
cortex "where is the nginx configuration file?"
```

### Updates and Maintenance

```bash
# System updates
cortex "update all packages to their latest versions"

# Specific updates
cortex "update nodejs to the latest LTS version"

# Security updates
cortex "apply all security updates only"

# Cleanup
cortex "remove unused packages and clear the package cache"
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Chaining Actions

Describe multi-step workflows naturally:

```bash
cortex "install nginx, enable it, and open port 80 in the firewall"

# Cortex will:
# 1. Install nginx package
# 2. Start and enable nginx service
# 3. Configure firewall rules
```

### Conditional Logic

Express conditions in plain language:

```bash
cortex "install docker if it's not already installed"

cortex "update nodejs only if the current version is below 18"
```

### Environment-Aware Commands

Cortex adapts to your system:

```bash
# Works on any distro
cortex "install the C compiler"

# Ubuntu/Debian: apt install build-essential
# Fedora: dnf install gcc
# Arch: pacman -S gcc
```

### Referencing Previous Context

Within a session, Cortex remembers context:

```bash
cortex "install postgresql"
# ... later in the session ...
cortex "now create a database called myapp"
# Cortex knows you're working with PostgreSQL
```

## Understanding Cortex Responses

### Action Preview

Before execution, Cortex shows what it will do:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Cortex will execute:                                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1. apt update                                               │
│ 2. apt install -y nginx                                     │
│ 3. systemctl start nginx                                    │
│ 4. systemctl enable nginx                                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Proceed? [Y/n/explain]                                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Explanation Mode

Type `explain` to understand why Cortex chose specific actions:

```
Why these commands?

1. `apt update` - Refreshes package lists to ensure we install
   the latest available version

2. `apt install -y nginx` - Installs nginx web server. The -y
   flag auto-confirms to avoid interactive prompts.

3. `systemctl start nginx` - Starts the nginx service immediately

4. `systemctl enable nginx` - Configures nginx to start on boot
```

### Error Handling

When something goes wrong, Cortex explains and suggests fixes:

```
❌ Installation failed: nginx

Reason: Port 80 is already in use by apache2

Suggestions:
1. Stop apache2: cortex "stop and disable apache2"
2. Use different port: cortex "install nginx on port 8080"
3. Remove apache2: cortex "remove apache2 completely"
```

## Command Modifiers

Add modifiers to change how commands execute:

### Dry Run

Preview without executing:

```bash
cortex --dry-run "install docker and kubernetes"
cortex -n "remove all unused packages"
```

### Verbose Mode

See detailed output:

```bash
cortex --verbose "update the system"
cortex -v "install development tools"
```

### Force Mode

Skip confirmations (use carefully):

```bash
cortex --yes "install recommended packages"
cortex -y "apply all updates"
```

### Quiet Mode

Minimal output:

```bash
cortex --quiet "install git"
cortex -q "update packages"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Dry Run

For unfamiliar operations, preview first:

```bash
cortex --dry-run "configure the system for production deployment"
```

### 2. Be Explicit About Versions

When versions matter, say so:

```bash
# Could install any version
cortex "install python"

# Gets exactly what you need
cortex "install python 3.11, not 3.12"
```

### 3. Describe the Goal, Not Just the Steps

Let Cortex figure out the implementation:

```bash
# ❌ Micromanaging
cortex "run apt update then apt install nginx then systemctl start nginx"

# ✅ Goal-oriented
cortex "set up nginx as a web server"
```

### 4. Use Sessions for Related Tasks

Group related work in one session for better context:

```bash
cortex "I'm setting up a LAMP stack"
cortex "install apache"
cortex "install mysql"
cortex "install php with mysql support"
cortex "verify everything is working"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Understood

If Cortex doesn't understand:

```bash
# Try rephrasing
cortex "install the thing for containers"  # Unclear
cortex "install docker for container management"  # Clear

# Or be more explicit
cortex "install docker-ce from the official docker repository"
```

### Unexpected Actions

If Cortex suggests something unexpected:

1. Don't proceed - type `n` to cancel
2. Ask for explanation - type `explain`
3. Rephrase with more context
4. Use `--dry-run` to preview alternatives

### Conflicting Interpretations

When multiple interpretations exist:

```bash
cortex "install java"

# Cortex asks:
# Which Java distribution?
# 1. OpenJDK 17 (recommended)
# 2. OpenJDK 11 (LTS)
# 3. OpenJDK 21 (latest)
# 4. Other (specify)
```
