# System Configuration

Cortex makes system administration accessible through natural language. Configure networking, manage users, control services, and tune system settings without memorizing complex commands.

## Service Management

### Starting and Stopping Services

```bash
# Start a service
cortex "start nginx"

# Stop a service
cortex "stop the mysql service"

cortex "reload nginx configuration without downtime"
```

### Service Status

```bash

cortex "show services that failed to start"
```

### Boot Configuration

```bash
# Enable on boot
cortex "enable nginx to start on boot"

# Disable
cortex "disable bluetooth from starting automatically"

# Check boot status
cortex "will docker start on boot?"
```

## User and Group Management

### Creating Users

```bash
# Basic user
cortex "create a new user called developer"

# With specific settings
cortex "create user deploy with home directory /opt/deploy and no login shell"

cortex "create a system user for running the app service"

# With sudo access
cortex "create user admin with sudo privileges"
```

### Managing Users
