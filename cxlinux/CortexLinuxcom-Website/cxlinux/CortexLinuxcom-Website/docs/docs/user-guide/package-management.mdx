# Package Management

Cortex provides a unified interface for package management across all major Linux distributions. Forget memorizing different package managers—just describe what you need.

## Universal Package Operations

### Installing Packages

```bash
# Single package
cortex "install nginx"

# Multiple packages
cortex "install git, curl, and wget"

# With specific version
cortex "install nodejs version 18"

# From specific repository
cortex "install docker from the official docker repo"
```

### Removing Packages

```bash
# Basic removal
cortex "remove nginx"

# Remove with configuration
cortex "completely remove nginx including config files"

# Remove unused dependencies
cortex "remove nginx and clean up unused dependencies"
```

### Updating Packages

```bash
# Update everything
cortex "update all packages"

# Update specific package
cortex "update nodejs to the latest version"

# Security updates only
cortex "apply security updates only"

# Update package lists
cortex "refresh package lists"
```

## Cross-Distribution Compatibility

Cortex translates your request to the appropriate package manager:

| Your Command | Ubuntu/Debian | Fedora/RHEL | Arch |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|------|
| "install git" | `apt install git` | `dnf install git` | `pacman -S git` |
| "remove nginx" | `apt remove nginx` | `dnf remove nginx` | `pacman -R nginx` |
| "update all" | `apt update && apt upgrade` | `dnf upgrade` | `pacman -Syu` |

### Package Name Translation

Cortex handles package naming differences:

```bash
cortex "install the apache web server"

# Ubuntu: apache2
# Fedora: httpd
# Arch: apache
```

## Package Search and Information

### Finding Packages

```bash
# Search by name
cortex "search for packages related to python machine learning"

# Search by function
cortex "what package provides the convert command?"

# List installed packages
cortex "show all installed packages"
cortex "list packages matching 'node*'"
```

### Package Information

```bash
# Package details
cortex "show information about the nginx package"

# Check if installed
cortex "is docker installed?"

# Version information
cortex "what version of python is installed?"

# Package files
cortex "what files does nginx install?"
```

## Repository Management

### Adding Repositories

```bash
# Official third-party repos
cortex "add the docker official repository"
cortex "add the nodejs 18.x repository"

# PPAs (Ubuntu)
cortex "add the graphics drivers PPA"

# Custom repositories
cortex "add repository https://packages.example.com/stable"
```

### Managing Repositories

```bash
# List repositories
cortex "show all configured repositories"

# Remove repository
cortex "remove the docker repository"

# Enable/disable
cortex "disable the testing repository"
```

## Dependency Management

### Understanding Dependencies

```bash
# Show dependencies
cortex "what does nginx depend on?"

# Reverse dependencies
cortex "what packages depend on openssl?"

# Check for broken dependencies
cortex "check for dependency problems"
```

### Resolving Issues

```bash
# Fix broken packages
cortex "fix broken package dependencies"

# Force reinstall
cortex "reinstall nginx and its dependencies"

# Clean package cache
cortex "clear the package cache to free disk space"
```

## Version Management

### Specific Versions

```bash
# Install specific version
cortex "install nodejs 18.17.0"

# Downgrade
cortex "downgrade nginx to version 1.18"

# Pin version
cortex "install and pin postgresql to version 14"
```

### Version Queries

```bash
# Available versions
cortex "what versions of nodejs are available?"

# Check current version
cortex "what version of python is installed?"

# Compare versions
cortex "is my nginx version up to date?"
```

## Bulk Operations

### Installing Groups

```bash
# Development tools
cortex "install development tools for C/C++"

# Language environments
cortex "set up a complete python development environment"

# Server stacks
cortex "install the LEMP stack"
```

### From Requirements

```bash
# Package list file
cortex "install packages from packages.txt"

# Development dependencies
cortex "install all dependencies for this nodejs project"
```

## Package Verification

### Security Checks

```bash
# Verify package integrity
cortex "verify the integrity of installed packages"

# Check signatures
cortex "are all packages properly signed?"

# Security audit
cortex "check for packages with known vulnerabilities"
```

### Package Comparison

```bash
# Compare with fresh install
cortex "show packages that differ from a fresh install"

# Find manually installed
cortex "list manually installed packages"

# Package history
cortex "show package installation history"
```

## Cleanup and Maintenance

### Removing Unused Packages

```bash
# Auto-remove
cortex "remove unused packages"

# Clean cache
cortex "clear package cache"

# Remove old kernels
cortex "remove old kernel versions keeping the last two"
```

### Disk Space

```bash
# Cache size
cortex "how much disk space is the package cache using?"

# Package sizes
cortex "show largest installed packages"

# Free space
cortex "clean up packages to free disk space"
```

## Offline and Air-Gapped Systems

### Download for Later

```bash
# Download without installing
cortex "download nginx and dependencies for offline install"

# Create local mirror
cortex "mirror the security updates repository"
```

### Install from Local

```bash
# Install from file
cortex "install nginx from the downloaded package"

# Local repository
cortex "install packages from /media/packages"
```

## Configuration Handling

### Package Configuration

```bash
# Reconfigure
cortex "reconfigure the keyboard settings"

# Show configuration
cortex "show nginx package configuration options"

# Reset to defaults
cortex "reset nginx configuration to package defaults"
```

### Configuration Files

```bash
# Keep or replace
cortex "update packages but keep my configuration files"

# Find modified configs
cortex "show configuration files I've modified"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Package Not Found

```bash
cortex "install superapp"
# Error: Package 'superapp' not found

# Try:
cortex "search for packages named like superapp"
cortex "what package provides superapp?"
```

#### Dependency Conflicts

```bash
# Let Cortex resolve
cortex "install package-a, resolve any conflicts automatically"

# Or investigate
cortex "why can't package-a and package-b be installed together?"
```

#### Locked Package Database

```bash
cortex "fix the locked package database"
cortex "another package manager is running, wait for it"
```

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# System check
cortex "check the package system health"

# Repair
cortex "repair the package database"

# Logs
cortex "show recent package manager errors"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Update Before Installing

```bash
cortex "update package lists and then install nginx"
```

### 2. Use Dry Run for Major Changes

```bash
cortex --dry-run "upgrade all packages"
```

### 3. Keep Track of Manual Installs

```bash
cortex "mark nginx as manually installed"
```

### 4. Regular Maintenance

```bash
cortex "perform weekly package maintenance"
# Updates, cleanup, and security checks
```
