## Week 1: Awareness & Problem Agitation

### Day 1 - Monday
**Post 1 (9am):**
```
47 Stack Overflow tabs.
6 hours debugging CUDA.
One broken kernel update.

Sound familiar?

We built Cortex Linux so you never have to memorize another Linux command.

Tell your server what you want. It figures out the rest.

github.com/cortexlinux/cortex
```

**Post 2 (5pm):**
```
"Why doesn't Linux just... understand what I want?"

That question led to 38,000+ lines of code.

Cortex Linux: Natural language system administration.

No wrappers. No copilots. A new paradigm.

```

### Day 2 - Tuesday
**Post 1 (9am):**
```
Traditional Linux: "apt-get install nvidia-driver-535"
Cortex Linux: "set up my GPU for ML"

Same result. Different century.

[Thread: How intent-based computing works]
```

**Thread continuation:**
```
1/5 Here's what happens when you type "set up my GPU for ML":

1. Cortex detects your hardware (RTX 4090? Got it)
2. Checks CUDA compatibility
3. Builds a dependency graph
4. Creates a rollback point
5. Executes with preview

All in seconds.
```

**Post 2 (5pm):**
```
The scariest words in Linux:

"Works on my machine"

Cortex creates reproducible environments with exact dependency versions.

Never blame the machine again.
```

---

### Day 3 - Wednesday
**Post 1 (9am):**
```
AI wrappers: "Here's a command, good luck!"

Cortex:
- Hardware detection
- Dependency resolution
- Sandboxed execution
- Instant rollback
- Full audit trail

That's the difference between a chatbot and an OS.
```

**Post 2 (12pm):**
```
Security isn't a feature. It's the foundation.

Every Cortex command:
- Runs in Firejail sandbox
- Requires your approval
- Gets logged
- Can be rolled back

AI should make you MORE secure, not less.
```

---

### Day 4 - Thursday
**Post 1 (9am):**
```
Poll: What's your biggest Linux pain point?
```
Options:
- Dependency hell
- Driver issues
- Config file nightmares
- All of the above

**Post 2 (5pm):**
```
Data scientists before Cortex:
"Installing TensorFlow + CUDA + cuDNN = 6 hours"

Data scientists with Cortex:
"cortex install tensorflow --optimize-gpu"
Time: 5 minutes

Same environment. 71x faster.
```

---

### Day 5 - Friday
**Post 1 (9am):**
```
Voice input is live.

Talk to your server. Press F9. Say what you need.

"Install PyTorch with Flash Attention support"

Cortex handles the rest.

[Video: 30-second demo of voice command]
```

**Post 2 (5pm):**
```
Weekend project idea:

Set up Cortex on a fresh VM.
Time how long it takes vs your last install.

Our beta testers report 10-20x faster setup times.

What's your record? Reply with times!
```

---

### Day 6 - Saturday
**Post 1 (12pm):**
```
The open source community built something incredible with Linux.

We're not replacing it. We're giving it a new interface.

Cortex is built ON Linux, FOR Linux users.

BSL licensed. Community first.
```

---

### Day 7 - Sunday
**Post 1 (12pm):**
```
Week 1 recap:

- Natural language commands
- Hardware-aware optimization
- Voice input
- Sandboxed execution
- Instant rollback

What feature should we deep-dive next week?

Reply with your vote!
```

---

## Week 2: Features & Social Proof

### Day 8 - Monday
**Post 1 (9am):**
```
"But what if the AI suggests something dangerous?"

46 dangerous pattern detectors.
Firejail isolation.
Preview before execute.
One-click rollback.

We thought about this more than you did.
```

**Post 2 (5pm):**
```
The multi-LLM architecture:

- Claude for reasoning
- GPT-4 for search
- Kimi K2 for system ops
- Ollama for local/offline

No lock-in. Best tool for each job.
```

---

### Day 9 - Tuesday
**Post 1 (9am):**
```
Cortex works offline.

No internet? No problem.

Local LLMs (Mistral, Llama) handle your queries.

Your data never leaves your machine.
```

**Post 2 (5pm):**
```
Real feedback from our beta:

"This saved me 20 hours on my last project setup."

"Finally, Linux that works with you."

"Security features give me confidence to use AI at system level."

### Day 10 - Wednesday
**Post 1 (9am):**
```
Comparison thread:

Warp: Great terminal UX
Cortex: Deeper system integration

GitHub Copilot CLI: Command suggestions
Cortex: Full workflow automation + rollback

ChatGPT: General AI
Cortex: Linux-specific, sandboxed, local-first
```

**Post 2 (5pm):**
```
Use case: ML Engineers

Before: "PyTorch 2.1 + CUDA 12.1 + Flash Attention = 3 hours of conflicts"

After: "cortex install pytorch stable --compatible-cuda"

Resolution time: Automatic.
```

---

### Day 11 - Thursday
**Post 1 (9am):**
```
Pro tip: The `cortex history` command.

See everything you've installed.
When it happened.
What dependencies were pulled.

`cortex rollback <id>` to undo any of it.

Version control for your system.
```

**Post 2 (5pm):**
```
Building in public:

Current focus: v0.2.0
- Pro license validation
- Extended security patterns (46 -> 60+)
- .deb packages for apt install

Target: End of month

Follow for updates.
```

---

### Day 12 - Friday
**Post 1 (9am):**
```
The dashboard is underrated.

`cortex dashboard`

- System health
- Recent operations
- Active processes
- Resource usage

All in your terminal. No browser needed.

```

**Post 2 (5pm):**
```
Weekend challenge:

Find a Linux task that takes you 30+ minutes.
Reply here.

We'll show you how Cortex handles it.

Best one gets featured!
```

This is what we're building for.
```

---

### Day 14 - Sunday
**Post 1 (12pm):**
```

1. Intent > Instructions
2. Safety is non-negotiable
3. Local-first, multi-LLM
4. Version control for your system
5. Voice is the future

What should we cover next?
