# Quick Start

This 5-minute guide will get you from zero to productivity with CX Linux. You'll learn the core concepts and execute your first AI-powered commands.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [Installed CX Linux](/docs/getting-started/installation)
- An API key from a [supported AI backend](/docs/reference/supported-ai-backends) (Anthropic Claude or OpenAI)

## Step 1: Configure Your AI Backend

Set up your preferred AI provider:

```bash
# Using Anthropic Claude (recommended)
export CX_AI_PROVIDER=anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxx...

# Or using OpenAI
export CX_AI_PROVIDER=openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx...
```

:::tip Make it Permanent
Add these exports to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` to persist across sessions.
:::

## Step 2: Your First Command

Try a simple command to verify everything works:

```bash
cx "what is my current disk usage"
```

CX Linux will:
1. Parse your natural language request
2. Generate the appropriate shell command
3. Display the command for your approval
4. Execute and show the results

**Example output:**

```
> Understanding request: "what is my current disk usage"

Suggested command:
  df -h

Execute this command? [Y/n]: y

Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1       500G  150G  350G  30% /
/dev/sda2       1.0T  400G  600G  40% /home
```

## Step 3: Install Software

Use natural language to install packages:

```bash
cx "install docker and docker compose"
```

**Example interaction:**

```
> Understanding request: "install docker and docker compose"

I'll help you install Docker and Docker Compose. Here's the plan:

1. Install Docker Engine
2. Add your user to the docker group
3. Install Docker Compose plugin

Suggested commands:
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install docker.io docker-compose-v2
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

Execute these commands? [Y/n]:
```

## Step 4: Try Dry-Run Mode

Preview commands without executing them using the `--dry-run` flag:

```bash
cx --dry-run "remove all unused docker images"
```

This is perfect for:
- Learning what commands CX Linux would run
- Reviewing potentially destructive operations
- Understanding complex system tasks

## Step 5: Create Aliases

Speed up common tasks with aliases:

```bash
# Add to your shell configuration
# cx is the main command
alias cxd="cx --dry-run"
```

Now you can use:

```bash
cx "update all packages"
cxd "clean up temp files"
```

## Common Commands to Try

Here are some useful commands to explore CX Linux's capabilities:

### System Information

```bash
cx "show system information"
cx "how much memory is available"
cx "list all running services"
cx "what processes are using the most CPU"
```

### Package Management

```bash
cx "install nodejs and npm"
cx "update all packages"
cx "search for packages related to python"
cx "remove vim and install neovim"
```

### File Operations

```bash
cx "find all log files larger than 100MB"
cx "show disk usage by directory in /home"
cx "list files modified in the last 24 hours"
```

### Network

```bash
cx "show all open ports"
cx "check if port 8080 is available"
cx "display network interfaces and their IPs"
```

### Services

```bash
cx "restart nginx"
cx "check status of all failed services"
cx "enable ssh to start on boot"
```

## Understanding the Output

CX Linux provides structured output to keep you informed:

```
> Understanding request: "your request here"

Context:
  - Detected OS: Ubuntu 22.04
  - Package manager: apt
  - User: john (sudo available)

Suggested command:

## Safety Features

CX Linux includes built-in safety features:

- **Confirmation prompts** before executing any command
- **Dry-run mode** to preview without executing
- **Rollback support** for reversible operations
- **Warning flags** for potentially dangerous commands

:::warning Dangerous Command Detection
When CX Linux detects a potentially dangerous command (like `rm -rf`), it will display additional warnings and require explicit confirmation.
:::

## What's Next?

Now that you understand the basics, explore more features:

- [Configuration](/docs/getting-started/configuration) - Customize CX Linux behavior
- [Natural Language Commands](/docs/user-guide/natural-language-commands) - Master the command syntax
- [Dry-Run Mode](/docs/user-guide/dry-run-mode) - Safe command preview
- [Rollback & Recovery](/docs/user-guide/rollback-recovery) - Undo changes when needed
