Yes! But complete claimed bounties before claiming new ones.

### What if someone else is working on the same issue?

First to claim gets priority. If they don't deliver, the bounty reopens.

### Can I suggest a bounty for an issue?

Yes! Comment on the issue requesting a bounty, and we'll evaluate.

### Do partial solutions get partial payment?

Sometimes. If your work is useful but incomplete, we may offer partial payment at our discretion.

### Can teams work on bounties?

Yes, but payment goes to one person who can split it with their team.
