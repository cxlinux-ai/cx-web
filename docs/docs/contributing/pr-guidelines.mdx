# PR Guidelines

This guide covers how to create and submit pull requests to CX Linux. Following these guidelines helps maintainers review your changes quickly.

## Before You Start

### Check Existing Work

1. Search [existing PRs](https://github.com/cxlinux-ai/cx-core/pulls) - Is someone already working on this?
2. Search [issues](https://github.com/cxlinux-ai/cx-core/issues) - Is there a related issue?
3. Check [discussions](https://github.com/cxlinux-ai/cx-core/discussions) - Has this been discussed?

### Create an Issue First

For non-trivial changes:

1. Open an issue describing your proposed change
2. Wait for feedback from maintainers
3. Get approval before starting significant work

This prevents wasted effort on changes we can't accept.

## Creating Your PR

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

```
feature/add-snap-support
fix/package-version-parsing
docs/improve-installation-guide
refactor/simplify-config-loading
```

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance

Examples:

```
feat(packages): add flatpak support

Add support for installing Flatpak packages through natural
language commands.

Closes #234
```

```
fix(cli): handle spaces in package names

Package names with spaces were causing parse errors.
Now properly quoted when passed to package manager.

Fixes #456
```

### Keeping Commits Clean

```bash
# Squash messy commits before PR
git rebase -i main

# Keep commits atomic and meaningful
# Each commit should be a logical unit
```

## PR Template

| Breaking change | 1-2 weeks |

### Responding to Feedback

- Address all comments
- Explain your reasoning if you disagree
- Mark conversations as resolved when addressed
- Request re-review when ready

## Common Issues

### CI Failures

```bash
# Check formatting
cargo fmt --check

# Run clippy
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Run tests
cargo test

# Check documentation
cargo doc
```

### Merge Conflicts

```bash
# Update your branch
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main

# Resolve conflicts
# Then force push
git push --force-with-lease
```

### Stale PRs

PRs without activity for 14 days may be closed. To prevent:

- Respond to review comments promptly
- Ask for help if stuck
- Update the PR description with status

## Special Cases

### Breaking Changes

Breaking changes require:

1. Discussion in an issue first
2. Clear justification
3. Migration guide
4. Deprecation period (when possible)

### Security Fixes

For security issues:

1. Do NOT open a public PR
2. Report via [security policy](https://github.com/cxlinux-ai/cx-core/security/policy)
3. Work with maintainers on fix
4. PR may be expedited

### Documentation-Only

Documentation PRs have lighter requirements:

- No tests needed
- Faster review
- Can be merged by any maintainer

## After Merge

### What Happens Next

1. CI builds release artifacts
2. Changes appear in next release
3. You're credited in changelog
4. Bounty payment processed (if applicable)

### Getting Credit

Contributors are credited in:

- `CHANGELOG.md`
- Release notes
- Contributors page
- Annual report

## Tips for Success

### Do

- ✅ Start small - First PR should be simple
- ✅ Communicate early - Ask before major work
- ✅ Test thoroughly - On multiple distros if possible
- ✅ Document your code - Others will maintain it
- ✅ Be patient - Reviews take time

### Don't

- ❌ Submit huge PRs - Hard to review
- ❌ Mix unrelated changes - Keep PRs focused
- ❌ Ignore CI failures - Fix them
- ❌ Get discouraged - Feedback improves code
- ❌ Disappear - Respond to reviews
