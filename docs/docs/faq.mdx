# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about CX Linux. Can't find your answer? Ask in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ASvzWcuTfk) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/cxlinux/cx-linux/discussions).

## General Questions

### What is CX Linux?

CX Linux is an AI-powered command-line tool that lets you manage your Linux system using natural language. Instead of memorizing exact commands, you describe what you want to do, and CX figures out the right commands.

```bash
# Instead of: sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx && sudo systemctl enable nginx
cx "install nginx and enable it on boot"
```

### Is CX a Linux distribution?

No. CX is a **tool** that works on existing Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, and many others. It enhances your current system without replacing it.

### What distributions are supported?

CX supports:

- **Debian-based**: Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS
- **Red Hat-based**: Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, Rocky Linux
- **Arch-based**: Arch Linux, Manjaro, EndeavourOS
- **Others**: openSUSE, Alpine Linux, Gentoo

### Is CX free?

Yes! CX is open source and free to use. The local AI model runs on your machine at no cost.

Optional cloud backends (OpenAI, Anthropic) have their own costs if you choose to use them.

### Do I need an internet connection?

**No** - CX's local AI model works completely offline.

**Yes** - Only if you choose to use cloud AI backends or need to install packages from online repositories.

## Installation

### How do I install CX?

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cxlinux.com/install.sh | bash
```

See [Installation Guide](/docs/getting-started/installation) for detailed instructions.

### Why does installation require sudo?

CX needs sudo to:
- Install to system directories (`/usr/local/bin`)
- Download and set up AI models
- Configure shell completions

The CX binary itself runs as your user.

### Can I install without root/sudo?

Yes, use the local installation option:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cxlinux.com/install.sh | bash -s -- --local
```

This installs to `~/.cx/` instead of system directories.

### How do I update CX?

```bash
cx update
```

Or reinstall using the installation script.

### How do I uninstall?

```bash
cx uninstall
```

Or manually remove:
```bash
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/cx
rm -rf ~/.cx
```

## Usage

### Is my data private?

**With local backend (default):** Yes, completely. All processing happens on your machine. Nothing is sent anywhere.

**With cloud backends:** Your prompts are sent to the AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic). Review their privacy policies.

### What if CX makes a mistake?

1. **Preview first** - Use dry-run mode: `cx --dry-run "your command"`
2. **Confirm** - CX shows what it will do before executing
3. **Rollback** - If something goes wrong: `cx rollback`

### Can CX damage my system?

CX has safety measures:

- Confirms before dangerous operations
- Creates snapshots before changes
- Blocks obviously harmful commands
- Dry-run mode for previewing

However, like any powerful tool, use it responsibly. Always review what CX proposes before confirming.

### Why didn't CX understand my command?

Try:

1. **Be more specific**: "install python" → "install python 3.11 with pip"
2. **Rephrase**: Different wording might help
3. **Check dry-run**: `cx --dry-run "your command"` to see interpretation
4. **Use verbose**: `cx --verbose "your command"` for more info

### How do I use CX in scripts?

Use non-interactive mode:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export CORTEX_YES=true
export CORTEX_NONINTERACTIVE=true

cx "install nginx"
cx "configure nginx for static site"
```

### Does CX work with sudo?

Yes, CX will use sudo when needed:

```bash
cx "install nginx"  # Automatically uses sudo for apt/dnf
```

For explicit sudo usage:
```bash
cx "run apt update with sudo"
```

## AI and Models

### How does the AI work?

CX uses a fine-tuned language model trained specifically for Linux system administration. It:

1. Understands your natural language request
2. Maps it to appropriate system commands
3. Considers your distribution and context
4. Executes or previews the commands

### What AI backends are available?

| Backend | Privacy | Cost | Requirements |
|---------|---------|------|--------------|
| Local (default) | Full | Free | 4-8GB RAM |
| Ollama | Full | Free | 4-8GB RAM |
| OpenAI | Low | Paid | API key |
| Anthropic | Low | Paid | API key |

### How do I change the AI backend?

```bash
# Use OpenAI
cx backend set openai
cx config set backend.api_key YOUR_KEY

# Use local
cx backend set local
```

### Does CX learn from my usage?

**Local backend:** No, the model doesn't learn or update based on your usage.

**Cloud backends:** Check provider policies. CX doesn't store your queries.

### How accurate is CX?

For common tasks (installations, service management, basic configuration), accuracy is high (>95%). For complex or unusual requests, review with dry-run mode first.

## Performance

### How much RAM does CX need?

| Model | Minimum RAM |
|-------|-------------|
| cx-3b | 4GB |
| cx-7b (default) | 8GB |
| cx-13b | 16GB |

### Is CX slow?

First command after starting may take 2-3 seconds for model loading. Subsequent commands are faster (<1 second).

Cloud backends may be faster but have network latency.

### Does CX use GPU?

CX automatically uses GPU acceleration if available:
- NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA
- AMD GPUs with ROCm
- Apple Silicon with Metal

To force CPU-only:
```bash
cx config set backend.acceleration cpu
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found" after installation

Restart your shell or run:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

Or add to PATH manually:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.cx/bin:$PATH"
```

### "Permission denied" errors

Check if the operation needs sudo:
```bash
cx "install nginx"  # CX handles sudo
```

If issues persist:
```bash
cx diagnose
```

### "AI backend not responding"

For local backend:
```bash
# Check if model is loaded
cx backend test

# Restart backend
cx backend restart
```

For cloud backends:
- Check API key is valid
- Check internet connection
- Check rate limits

### "Package not found"

```bash
# Update package lists
cx "update package lists"

# Then try again
cx "install package-name"
```

### How do I report a bug?

1. Check [existing issues](https://github.com/cxlinux/cx-linux/issues)
2. Gather info: `cx diagnose > diagnostics.txt`
3. [Open new issue](https://github.com/cxlinux/cx-linux/issues/new)

## Comparison

### How is CX different from ChatGPT?

| Feature | CX | ChatGPT |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Runs locally | ✅ | ❌ |
| Executes commands | ✅ | ❌ |
| Linux-specific | ✅ | ❌ |
| Rollback support | ✅ | ❌ |
| Offline capable | ✅ | ❌ |

### How is CX different from shell aliases?

- **Aliases**: Static shortcuts you define
- **CX**: Dynamic understanding of natural language

```bash
# Alias: Requires you to remember the alias name
alias update='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade'

# CX: Natural expression of intent
cx "update my system"
cx "update everything"
cx "apply all updates"
```

### How is CX different from tldr/cheat?

- **tldr/cheat**: Show examples for specific commands
- **CX**: Execute commands from your description

```bash
# tldr: Shows how to use tar
tldr tar

# CX: Does what you want
cx "extract archive.tar.gz to /opt"
```

## Security

### Is CX secure?

CX follows security best practices:

- Local AI keeps data on your machine
- No telemetry (unless explicitly enabled)
- Commands are validated before execution
- Dangerous operations require confirmation

### Can CX access my files?

Only files you explicitly reference in commands. CX doesn't scan or index your files.

### What about command injection?

CX sanitizes inputs before constructing commands. However, always review commands in dry-run mode for sensitive operations.
