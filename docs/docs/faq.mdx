# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about Cortex Linux. Can't find your answer? Ask in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ASvzWcuTfk) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/cortexlinux/cortex-linux/discussions).

## General Questions

### What is Cortex Linux?

Cortex Linux is an AI-powered command-line tool that lets you manage your Linux system using natural language. Instead of memorizing exact commands, you describe what you want to do, and Cortex figures out the right commands.

```bash
# Instead of: sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx && sudo systemctl enable nginx
cortex "install nginx and enable it on boot"
```

### Is Cortex a Linux distribution?

No. Cortex is a **tool** that works on existing Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, and many others. It enhances your current system without replacing it.

### What distributions are supported?

Cortex supports:

- **Debian-based**: Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS
- **Red Hat-based**: Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, Rocky Linux
- **Arch-based**: Arch Linux, Manjaro, EndeavourOS
- **Others**: openSUSE, Alpine Linux, Gentoo

### Is Cortex free?

Yes! Cortex is open source and free to use. The local AI model runs on your machine at no cost.

Optional cloud backends (OpenAI, Anthropic) have their own costs if you choose to use them.

### Do I need an internet connection?

**No** - Cortex's local AI model works completely offline.

**Yes** - Only if you choose to use cloud AI backends or need to install packages from online repositories.

## Installation

### How do I install Cortex?

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cortexlinux.com/install.sh | bash
```

See [Installation Guide](/docs/getting-started/installation) for detailed instructions.

### Why does installation require sudo?

Cortex needs sudo to:
- Install to system directories (`/usr/local/bin`)
- Download and set up AI models
- Configure shell completions

The Cortex binary itself runs as your user.

### Can I install without root/sudo?

Yes, use the local installation option:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cortexlinux.com/install.sh | bash -s -- --local
```

This installs to `~/.cortex/` instead of system directories.

### How do I update Cortex?

```bash
cortex update
```

Or reinstall using the installation script.

### How do I uninstall?

```bash
cortex uninstall
```

Or manually remove:
```bash
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/cortex
rm -rf ~/.cortex
```

## Usage

### Is my data private?

**With local backend (default):** Yes, completely. All processing happens on your machine. Nothing is sent anywhere.

**With cloud backends:** Your prompts are sent to the AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic). Review their privacy policies.

### What if Cortex makes a mistake?

1. **Preview first** - Use dry-run mode: `cortex --dry-run "your command"`
2. **Confirm** - Cortex shows what it will do before executing
3. **Rollback** - If something goes wrong: `cortex rollback`

### Can Cortex damage my system?

Cortex has safety measures:

- Confirms before dangerous operations
- Creates snapshots before changes
- Blocks obviously harmful commands
- Dry-run mode for previewing

However, like any powerful tool, use it responsibly. Always review what Cortex proposes before confirming.

### Why didn't Cortex understand my command?

Try:

1. **Be more specific**: "install python" → "install python 3.11 with pip"
2. **Rephrase**: Different wording might help
3. **Check dry-run**: `cortex --dry-run "your command"` to see interpretation
4. **Use verbose**: `cortex --verbose "your command"` for more info

### How do I use Cortex in scripts?

Use non-interactive mode:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export CORTEX_YES=true
export CORTEX_NONINTERACTIVE=true

cortex "install nginx"
cortex "configure nginx for static site"
```

### Does Cortex work with sudo?

Yes, Cortex will use sudo when needed:

```bash
cortex "install nginx"  # Automatically uses sudo for apt/dnf
```

For explicit sudo usage:
```bash
cortex "run apt update with sudo"
```

## AI and Models

### How does the AI work?

Cortex uses a fine-tuned language model trained specifically for Linux system administration. It:

1. Understands your natural language request
2. Maps it to appropriate system commands
3. Considers your distribution and context
4. Executes or previews the commands

### What AI backends are available?

| Backend | Privacy | Cost | Requirements |
|---------|---------|------|--------------|
| Local (default) | Full | Free | 4-8GB RAM |
| Ollama | Full | Free | 4-8GB RAM |
| OpenAI | Low | Paid | API key |
| Anthropic | Low | Paid | API key |

### How do I change the AI backend?

```bash
# Use OpenAI
cortex backend set openai
cortex config set backend.api_key YOUR_KEY

# Use local
cortex backend set local
```

### Does Cortex learn from my usage?

**Local backend:** No, the model doesn't learn or update based on your usage.

**Cloud backends:** Check provider policies. Cortex doesn't store your queries.

### How accurate is Cortex?

For common tasks (installations, service management, basic configuration), accuracy is high (>95%). For complex or unusual requests, review with dry-run mode first.

## Performance

### How much RAM does Cortex need?

| Model | Minimum RAM |
|-------|-------------|
| cortex-3b | 4GB |
| cortex-7b (default) | 8GB |
| cortex-13b | 16GB |

### Is Cortex slow?

First command after starting may take 2-3 seconds for model loading. Subsequent commands are faster (<1 second).

Cloud backends may be faster but have network latency.

### Does Cortex use GPU?

Cortex automatically uses GPU acceleration if available:
- NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA
- AMD GPUs with ROCm
- Apple Silicon with Metal

To force CPU-only:
```bash
cortex config set backend.acceleration cpu
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found" after installation

Restart your shell or run:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

Or add to PATH manually:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.cortex/bin:$PATH"
```

### "Permission denied" errors

Check if the operation needs sudo:
```bash
cortex "install nginx"  # Cortex handles sudo
```

If issues persist:
```bash
cortex diagnose
```

### "AI backend not responding"

For local backend:
```bash
# Check if model is loaded
cortex backend test

# Restart backend
cortex backend restart
```

For cloud backends:
- Check API key is valid
- Check internet connection
- Check rate limits

### "Package not found"

```bash
# Update package lists
cortex "update package lists"

# Then try again
cortex "install package-name"
```

### How do I report a bug?

1. Check [existing issues](https://github.com/cortexlinux/cortex-linux/issues)
2. Gather info: `cortex diagnose > diagnostics.txt`
3. [Open new issue](https://github.com/cortexlinux/cortex-linux/issues/new)

```bash
# Alias: Requires you to remember the alias name
alias update='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade'

# Cortex: Natural expression of intent
cortex "update my system"
cortex "update everything"
cortex "apply all updates"
```

### How is Cortex different from tldr/cheat?

- **tldr/cheat**: Show examples for specific commands
- **Cortex**: Execute commands from your description

```bash
# tldr: Shows how to use tar
tldr tar

# Cortex: Does what you want
cortex "extract archive.tar.gz to /opt"
```

## Security

### Is Cortex secure?

Cortex follows security best practices:

- Local AI keeps data on your machine
- No telemetry (unless explicitly enabled)
- Commands are validated before execution
- Dangerous operations require confirmation

### Can Cortex access my files?

Only files you explicitly reference in commands. Cortex doesn't scan or index your files.

### What about command injection?

Cortex sanitizes inputs before constructing commands. However, always review commands in dry-run mode for sensitive operations.
