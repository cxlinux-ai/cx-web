# Package Management

CX Linux provides a unified interface for package management across all major Linux distributions. Forget memorizing different package managers—just describe what you need.

## Universal Package Operations

### Installing Packages

```bash
# Single package
cx "install nginx"

# Multiple packages
cx "install git, curl, and wget"

# With specific version
cx "install nodejs version 18"

# From specific repository
cx "install docker from the official docker repo"
```

### Removing Packages

```bash
# Basic removal
cx "remove nginx"

# Remove with configuration
cx "completely remove nginx including config files"

# Remove unused dependencies
cx "remove nginx and clean up unused dependencies"
```

### Updating Packages

```bash
# Update everything
cx "update all packages"

# Update specific package
cx "update nodejs to the latest version"

# Security updates only
cx "apply security updates only"

# Update package lists
cx "refresh package lists"
```

## Cross-Distribution Compatibility

CX Linux translates your request to the appropriate package manager:

| Your Command | Ubuntu/Debian | Fedora/RHEL | Arch |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|------|
| "install git" | `apt install git` | `dnf install git` | `pacman -S git` |
| "remove nginx" | `apt remove nginx` | `dnf remove nginx` | `pacman -R nginx` |
| "update all" | `apt update && apt upgrade` | `dnf upgrade` | `pacman -Syu` |

### Package Name Translation

CX Linux handles package naming differences:

```bash
cx "install the apache web server"

# Ubuntu: apache2
# Fedora: httpd
# Arch: apache
```

## Package Search and Information

### Finding Packages

```bash
# Search by name
cx "search for packages related to python machine learning"

# Search by function
cx "what package provides the convert command?"

# List installed packages
cx "show all installed packages"
cx "list packages matching 'node*'"
```

### Package Information

```bash
# Package details
cx "show information about the nginx package"

# Check if installed
cx "is docker installed?"

# Version information
cx "what version of python is installed?"

# Package files
cx "what files does nginx install?"
```

## Repository Management

### Adding Repositories

```bash
# Official third-party repos
cx "add the docker official repository"
cx "add the nodejs 18.x repository"

# PPAs (Ubuntu)
cx "add the graphics drivers PPA"

# Custom repositories
cx "add repository https://packages.example.com/stable"
```

### Managing Repositories

```bash
# List repositories
cx "show all configured repositories"

# Remove repository
cx "remove the docker repository"

# Enable/disable
cx "disable the testing repository"
```

## Dependency Management

### Understanding Dependencies

```bash
# Show dependencies
cx "what does nginx depend on?"

# Reverse dependencies
cx "what packages depend on openssl?"

# Check for broken dependencies
cx "check for dependency problems"
```

### Resolving Issues

```bash
# Fix broken packages
cx "fix broken package dependencies"

# Force reinstall
cx "reinstall nginx and its dependencies"

# Clean package cache
cx "clear the package cache to free disk space"
```

## Version Management

### Specific Versions

```bash
# Install specific version
cx "install nodejs 18.17.0"

# Downgrade
cx "downgrade nginx to version 1.18"

# Pin version
cx "install and pin postgresql to version 14"
```

### Version Queries

```bash
# Available versions
cx "what versions of nodejs are available?"

# Check current version
cx "what version of python is installed?"

# Compare versions
cx "is my nginx version up to date?"
```

## Bulk Operations

### Installing Groups

```bash
# Development tools
cx "install development tools for C/C++"

# Language environments
cx "set up a complete python development environment"

# Server stacks
cx "install the LEMP stack"
```

### From Requirements

```bash
# Package list file
cx "install packages from packages.txt"

# Development dependencies
cx "install all dependencies for this nodejs project"
```

## Package Verification

### Security Checks

```bash
# Verify package integrity
cx "verify the integrity of installed packages"

# Check signatures
cx "are all packages properly signed?"

# Security audit
cx "check for packages with known vulnerabilities"
```

### Package Comparison

```bash
# Compare with fresh install
cx "show packages that differ from a fresh install"

# Find manually installed
cx "list manually installed packages"

# Package history
cx "show package installation history"
```

## Cleanup and Maintenance

### Removing Unused Packages

```bash
# Auto-remove
cx "remove unused packages"

# Clean cache
cx "clear package cache"

# Remove old kernels
cx "remove old kernel versions keeping the last two"
```

### Disk Space

```bash
# Cache size
cx "how much disk space is the package cache using?"

# Package sizes
cx "show largest installed packages"

# Free space
cx "clean up packages to free disk space"
```

## Offline and Air-Gapped Systems

### Download for Later

```bash
# Download without installing
cx "download nginx and dependencies for offline install"

# Create local mirror
cx "mirror the security updates repository"
```

### Install from Local

```bash
# Install from file
cx "install nginx from the downloaded package"

# Local repository
cx "install packages from /media/packages"
```

## Configuration Handling

### Package Configuration

```bash
# Reconfigure
cx "reconfigure the keyboard settings"

# Show configuration
cx "show nginx package configuration options"

# Reset to defaults
cx "reset nginx configuration to package defaults"
```

### Configuration Files

```bash
# Keep or replace
cx "update packages but keep my configuration files"

# Find modified configs
cx "show configuration files I've modified"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Package Not Found

```bash
cx "install superapp"
# Error: Package 'superapp' not found

# Try:
cx "search for packages named like superapp"
cx "what package provides superapp?"
```

#### Dependency Conflicts

```bash
# Let CX Linux resolve
cx "install package-a, resolve any conflicts automatically"

# Or investigate
cx "why can't package-a and package-b be installed together?"
```

#### Locked Package Database

```bash
cx "fix the locked package database"
cx "another package manager is running, wait for it"
```

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# System check
cx "check the package system health"

# Repair
cx "repair the package database"

# Logs
cx "show recent package manager errors"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Update Before Installing

```bash
cx "update package lists and then install nginx"
```

### 2. Use Dry Run for Major Changes

```bash
cortex --dry-run "upgrade all packages"
```

### 3. Keep Track of Manual Installs

```bash
cx "mark nginx as manually installed"
```

### 4. Regular Maintenance

```bash
cx "perform weekly package maintenance"
# Updates, cleanup, and security checks
```
