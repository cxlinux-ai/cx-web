          q: "Is CX safe? Won't it break my system?",
          a: "CX is designed with security as the #1 priority. Here's how we protect your system:\n\n• Sandboxed Execution: Every command runs in an isolated Firejail container with no direct kernel access\n• Preview Before Execute: You see and approve every command before it runs\n• Instant Rollback: We create snapshots before major changes. Undo anything in seconds.\n• Command Validation: Dangerous commands (like rm -rf /) are blocked automatically\n• Audit Logging: Every action is logged for complete transparency\n\nThink of it like having a professional system administrator who shows you their plan before doing anything."
        },
        {
          q: "How do you prevent dangerous commands like 'rm -rf /'?",
          a: "Multiple layers of protection:\n\n1. Blacklist: Destructive commands are blocked by default\n2. Dry-run mode: Test changes in simulation first\n3. User confirmation: System-wide changes require your explicit approval\n4. Severity scoring: AI classifies command risk level (safe/caution/danger)\n5. Rollback ready: Even approved commands can be undone\n\nYou can review our security architecture on GitHub."
        },
        {
          q: "What if the AI hallucinates or makes mistakes?",
          a: "We've built multiple safeguards:\n\n• Command Validation: Every AI-generated command is validated against known patterns\n• Testing First: Commands are tested in sandbox before running on your system\n• Human-in-the-loop: You approve all critical operations\n• Learning System: When errors occur, CX learns and never repeats them\n• Confidence Scoring: Low-confidence suggestions require extra confirmation\n\nThe AI suggests, you decide. Always."
        },
        {
          q: "Does CX have root access to my system?",
          a: "No. CX runs with the same permissions as your user account. When root/sudo is needed:\n\n1. CX asks for your sudo password (just like any other program)\n2. Shows you exactly what will run with elevated permissions\n3. Waits for your approval\n4. You can always say no\n\nCX never stores your password or runs elevated commands without permission."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I review commands before they execute?",
          a: "Yes, always. The workflow is:\n\n1. You: \"Install Oracle optimized for my GPU\"\n2. CX: Analyzes and shows you the plan:\n   - Will install: CUDA 12.3, Oracle 23c, dependencies X, Y, Z\n   - Will modify: /etc/oracle/config, ~/.bashrc\n   - Estimated time: 4 minutes\n3. You: Approve or reject\n4. CX: Executes only after approval\n\nYou can also enable \"explain mode\" where CX describes what each command does in plain English."

Here's the key difference:\n\nTERMINAL WRAPPERS (Warp, Gemini CLI):\n• Helps you write individual commands\n• You still need to know what to do\n• No system-wide awareness\n• Single command at a time\n\nCODE EDITORS (Claude Code):\n• Focused on writing code\n• Not designed for system administration\n• Doesn't handle OS-level operations\n\nCX (OS-LEVEL AI LAYER):\n• Executes ANY task you can do on Linux\n• Multi-step workflow orchestration\n• Understands system context and dependencies\n• Hardware-aware optimization\n• Full system administration capabilities\n• Package management is just ONE of unlimited capabilities\n\nExample: \"Set up a secure web server with SSL, monitoring, and automated backups\"\n• Terminal tools: You manually run 50+ commands over hours\n• CX: Understands your intent → Plans multi-step workflow → Installs nginx, certbot, prometheus → Configures firewall → Sets up cron jobs → Verifies everything works"

          q: "What is CX as an 'AI Layer'?",
          a: "CX is an intelligent layer that sits between you and Linux, translating your intent into execution:\n\nTraditional Linux: You → Terminal → Commands → OS\nCX: You → Natural Language → AI Layer → Any Linux Operation → OS\n\nThe AI Layer can execute ANY task on Linux:\n• System administration & configuration\n• Automation scripts & cron jobs\n• Security auditing & hardening\n• Performance tuning & optimization\n• Log analysis & troubleshooting\n• Infrastructure management\n• Development environment setup\n• Data processing pipelines\n• Network configuration\n• And literally anything else Linux can do\n\nPackage management is just one of many capabilities.

It's built on standard Linux with unlimited capabilities on top.\n\nWhat this means:\n• All your normal Linux tools still work (apt, vim, git, etc.)\n• You can drop to terminal anytime\n• Existing scripts and tools are compatible\n• You choose when to use CX vs manual commands\n• CX can do ANYTHING you could do manually—just faster\n\nThink of it as having a Linux expert available 24/7 who can execute any task."

CX is designed for:\n\n• Data scientists who need tools but don't want to become Linux experts\n• Developers who want to focus on code, not configuration\n• DevOps engineers who want to automate complex workflows\n• Sysadmins who want an intelligent assistant for any task\n• Students learning programming without OS barriers\n• Anyone who wants to accomplish tasks without memorizing commands\n\nYou can learn Linux through CX.
