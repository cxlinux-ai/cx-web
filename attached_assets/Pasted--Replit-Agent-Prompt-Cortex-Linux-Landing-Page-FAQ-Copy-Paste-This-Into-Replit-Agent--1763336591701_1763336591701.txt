FAQ CATEGORIES (expandable accordion style):

CATEGORY 1: SECURITY & SAFETY
Icon: 🔒

Q1: Is Cortex safe? Won't it break my system?
A: Cortex is designed with security as the #1 priority. Here's how we protect your system:
   - Sandboxed Execution: Every command runs in an isolated Firejail container with no direct kernel access
   - Preview Before Execute: You see and approve every command before it runs
   - Instant Rollback: We create snapshots before major changes. Undo anything in seconds.
   - Command Validation: Dangerous commands (like rm -rf /) are blocked automatically
   - Audit Logging: Every action is logged for complete transparency
   
   Think of it like having a professional system administrator who shows you their plan before doing anything.

Q2: How do you prevent dangerous commands like 'rm -rf /'?
A: Multiple layers of protection:
   1. Blacklist: Destructive commands are blocked by default
   2. Dry-run mode: Test changes in simulation first
   3. User confirmation: System-wide changes require your explicit approval
   4. Severity scoring: AI classifies command risk level (safe/caution/danger)
   5. Rollback ready: Even approved commands can be undone
   
   You can review our security architecture on GitHub: [link]

Q3: What if the AI hallucinates or makes mistakes?
A: We've built multiple safeguards:
   - Command Validation: Every AI-generated command is validated against known patterns
   - Testing First: Commands are tested in sandbox before running on your system
   - Human-in-the-loop: You approve all critical operations
   - Learning System: When errors occur, Cortex learns and never repeats them
   - Confidence Scoring: Low-confidence suggestions require extra confirmation
   
   The AI suggests, you decide. Always.

Q4: Does Cortex have root access to my system?
A: No. Cortex runs with the same permissions as your user account. When root/sudo is needed:
   1. Cortex asks for your sudo password (just like any other program)
   2. Shows you exactly what will run with elevated permissions
   3. Waits for your approval
   4. You can always say no
   
   Cortex never stores your password or runs elevated commands without permission.

Q5: Can I review commands before they execute?
A: Yes, always. The workflow is:
   1. You: "Install Oracle optimized for my GPU"
   2. Cortex: Analyzes and shows you the plan:
      - Will install: CUDA 12.3, Oracle 23c, dependencies X, Y, Z
      - Will modify: /etc/oracle/config, ~/.bashrc
      - Estimated time: 4 minutes
   3. You: Approve or reject
   4. Cortex: Executes only after approval
   
   You can also enable "explain mode" where Cortex describes what each command does in plain English.

CATEGORY 2: HOW IT WORKS
Icon: ⚙️

Q6: How is Cortex different from Warp/Gemini CLI/Claude Code?
A: Great question! Here's the key difference:
   
   TERMINAL WRAPPERS (Warp, Gemini CLI):
   - Helps you write commands
   - You still need to know what to install
   - No hardware awareness
   - No dependency resolution
   
   CODE EDITORS (Claude Code):
   - Focused on writing code
   - Not designed for system administration
   - Doesn't handle OS-level configuration
   
   CORTEX (OS-LEVEL):
   - Understands what you're trying to accomplish
   - Detects your hardware automatically
   - Resolves dependencies for you
   - Configures entire stack (not just one command)
   - Optimizes for your specific system
   
   Example: "Install TensorFlow optimized for my GPU"
   - Warp: Helps you write "pip install tensorflow"
   - Cortex: Detects RTX 4090 → Installs CUDA 12.3 → Installs TensorFlow-GPU 2.15 → Configures for your card → Runs verification
   
   [See full comparison table →]

Q7: What does "AI-native OS" mean technically?
A: Cortex is NOT replacing the Linux kernel. It's a layer that sits between you and the operating system:
   
   Traditional Linux: You → Terminal → Commands → OS
   Cortex Linux: You → Natural Language → AI Layer → Commands → OS
   
   The AI layer:
   - Translates your intent into commands
   - Understands hardware and dependencies
   - Generates installation plans
   - Executes in sandboxed environment
   - Learns from outcomes
   
   Under the hood, it's still Ubuntu 24.04. We're just making it understand you.

Q8: Does Cortex replace Linux or wrap it?
A: Cortex wraps Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. It's built on standard Debian packaging with an AI layer on top.
   
   What this means:
   - ✅ All your normal Linux tools still work (apt, vim, git, etc.)
   - ✅ You can drop to terminal anytime
   - ✅ Existing scripts and tools are compatible
   - ✅ You choose when to use Cortex vs manual commands
   
   Think of it as a smart assistant, not a replacement.

Q9: Do I need to know Linux to use Cortex?
A: No, that's the point! Cortex is designed for:
   - Data scientists who need tools but don't want to become Linux experts
   - Developers who want to focus on code, not configuration
   - Students learning programming without fighting the OS
   - Anyone frustrated by "dependency hell"
   
   You can learn Linux through Cortex. It explains what it's doing and why.

Q10: Does it work offline or require internet?
A: Hybrid approach:
   - Cloud Mode (default): Uses Claude API, works on any machine
   - Local Mode (optional): Runs LLM locally, requires GPU
   - Hybrid Mode (best): Local for simple tasks, cloud for complex ones
   
   You choose based on your privacy needs and hardware.
