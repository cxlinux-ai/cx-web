**Objective**
Build a reusable **comparison page system** for **Cortex Linux** and generate **three SEO-focused comparison pages**, with **built-in A/B testing and analytics specifically for users arriving from Google search**.

The system must allow us to:

* Test different page variants for organic traffic
* Measure which messaging converts better
* Clearly see results (CTR, engagement, conversion)
* Iterate based on data, not opinion

Tone: technical, honest, trust-building, developer-first.

---

## 1. Comparison Page Template (Reusable)

Create a reusable template that supports:

* Multiple competitors
* Multiple A/B variants per page
* Analytics + experiment tracking

Route structure:

```
/compare/[competitor]
```

---

## 2. A/B TESTING REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)

### Traffic Segmentation

* A/B tests must apply **only to users coming from Google / organic search**
* Detect traffic source via:

  * Referrer (`google.*`)
  * UTM parameters
* Non-Google traffic sees the default (control) variant

---

### Testable Elements (Variants)

Support A/B testing for:

**Hero Section**

* Headline copy
* Subheadline framing (speed vs safety vs ease)
* CTA text (“Try Cortex Free” vs “See It In Action”)

**Comparison Framing**

* Feature table emphasis order
* Icons vs text-heavy explanations

**Use Case Section**

* Scenario ordering
* Time-saved emphasis vs error-reduction emphasis

**CTA Placement**

* Above-the-fold vs after use cases
* Soft CTA vs strong CTA

Each variant must be configurable without redeploying code (env flags or config).

---

### Variant Assignment

* Deterministic assignment per user (cookie-based)
* Persist variant across sessions
* Even split by default (50/50)

---

## 3. ANALYTICS & VISIBILITY (CRITICAL)

### Events to Track

Track and store the following events:

* Page view (with competitor + variant)
* Scroll depth
* Time on page
* CTA clicks
* Install clicks
* Docs clicks
* Conversion (GitHub click / CLI install)

All events must include:

* Competitor name
* Variant ID
* Traffic source (Google vs other)

---

### Dashboards & Results

Provide:

* A simple analytics dashboard (or SQL-ready schema)
* Breakdown by:

  * Competitor
  * Variant
  * Traffic source
* Metrics:

  * Conversion rate
  * Bounce rate
  * Avg time on page
  * CTA click-through rate

Answerable questions:

* “Which headline converts better for Google traffic?”
* “Does honesty (‘when not to use Cortex’) increase trust?”
* “Which comparison wins installs?”

---

## 4. Comparison Page Template (Content Structure)

### HERO

* Dynamic headline:
  **“Cortex Linux vs {Competitor}”**
* Variant-tested subheadline
* Primary CTA (variant-tested)
* Secondary CTA: View Docs
* Summary comparison table (scannable)

---

### SIDE-BY-SIDE FEATURE TABLE

| Feature | Cortex Linux | {Competitor} |

* ✅ / ❌ / ⚠️ icons
* Tooltips explaining tradeoffs
* Neutral, accurate language

---

### REAL-WORLD USE CASES

3–4 realistic tasks.

For each:

* Task description
* Cortex natural language command
* Competitor commands/config
* Time estimate (minutes)
* Error risk

---

### “WHEN TO USE WHICH” (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Explicitly state:

* When Cortex is better
* When the competitor is better
* Who should not switch yet

(This section is tracked as a trust signal in analytics.)

---

### MIGRATION GUIDE

* Step-by-step
* What changes
* What doesn’t
* How to test safely (dry-run, rollback)

---

## 5. Generate These Three Pages

### 1. Cortex Linux vs `apt`

* Natural language vs package manager
* Cortex wraps apt (no replacement anxiety)
* Scenario: Install Nginx optimized for hardware

---

### 2. Cortex Linux vs Nix / NixOS

* Declarative configs vs AI intent
* Learning curve vs guarantees
* Scenario: Reproducible dev environment
* Positioning: coexistence, not replacement

---

### 3. Cortex Linux vs Manual CLI

* Docs/search vs intent
* Scenario: PostgreSQL replication
* Include:

  * Time saved
  * Command count
  * Failure points

---

## 6. SEO REQUIREMENTS

Per page:

* Target keyword: **“{Competitor} alternative”**
* 1,500+ words unique content
* FAQ section with schema markup
* Internal links to:

  * Features
  * Docs
  * Pricing
* Clean semantic HTML

---

## 7. Technical Implementation

* Framework: **Next.js**
* Dynamic routing: `/compare/[competitor]`
* Content: **MDX**
* Shared comparison component library
* A/B logic isolated and reusable
* Analytics-compatible with:

  * Plausible / PostHog / GA4
  * Or custom Supabase events table

---

## 8. Output Expectations

Generate:

* Page template
* Three complete comparison pages
* A/B testing logic
* Analytics event map
* Example dashboard or queries
* Clear comments explaining experimentation logic

The system must allow us to **prove** which version works better for Google traffic.
