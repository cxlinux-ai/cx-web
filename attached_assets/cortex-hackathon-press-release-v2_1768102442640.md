**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**SALT LAKE CITY, UT — January XX, 2026** — AI Venture Holdings LLC today announced the Cortex Linux Hackathon 2026, a global competition inviting developers to build the future of AI-powered Linux system administration. The hackathon launches February 17, 2026, with cash prizes and additional rewards to be announced on launch day.

Cortex Linux is an open-source, AI-native Linux distribution that translates natural language commands into system operations. Instead of memorizing complex terminal syntax or searching through documentation, users describe what they want in plain English — like "install a secure web server with SSL certificates" — and the Cortex AI package manager handles the installation, configuration, and troubleshooting automatically.

"We're building the AI layer for Linux," said Michael J. Morgan, CEO and Founder of AI Venture Holdings LLC. "Enterprise teams spend billions on system administration that AI can streamline. This hackathon invites the global developer community to help shape what AI-powered infrastructure should become."

### Two-Phase Competition Structure

**Phase 1: Ideation**
Participants submit innovative proposals for new features, enterprise integrations, monetization strategies, and technical improvements to the Cortex Linux platform. The best ideas advance to Phase 2 and receive cash awards.

**Phase 2: Implementation**
Selected teams build their proposals as working code, submitted via GitHub pull requests to the official Cortex Linux repository. Winning implementations become part of the core platform, with contributors credited in the project.

Prize amounts and category awards will be announced on the February 17 launch date. Registration is now open.

### Beyond Prizes: Real Career Value

The Cortex Linux Hackathon offers participants more than cash prizes:

- **GitHub Contributions** — Merged pull requests to a growing open-source AI infrastructure project
- **Certificates** — Official participation certificates for all contributors
- **Mentorship** — Direct access to senior Linux and AI developers
- **Community** — Networking with developers worldwide through Discord and live events
- **Recognition** — LinkedIn endorsements and portfolio-worthy project experience

### Why AI-Native Linux Matters

Linux powers 96% of cloud infrastructure, yet system administration remains largely manual. Administrators memorize thousands of commands, flags, and configuration patterns — knowledge that takes years to acquire. Cortex Linux bridges this gap with AI that understands intent and translates it to action.

The project targets a massive market opportunity: enterprise IT teams seeking to reduce training costs, documentation overhead, and human error in system operations. With provisional patents filed and an Apache 2.0 open-source license, Cortex Linux combines community-driven development with enterprise-ready features.
