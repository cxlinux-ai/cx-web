✅ RECOMMENDED REMOVALS / CLEANUPS
1. Repeated code blocks for features

You have multiple copies of the same feature list:

{ icon: Shield, title: "Sleep Better with Built-in Security", ... }
{ icon: Globe, title: "Deploy Anywhere, Scale Automatically", ... }
{ icon: Puzzle, title: "Extend Without Limits", ... }


These appear three times in your pasted content.
You should only keep them once.

2. Repeated comparisonData arrays

The entire comparisonData = [...] block also appears 3 times in the snippet.

You should only keep:

const comparisonData = [...]


one single time, at the top of the file OR in a separate /data/comparison.ts.

3. Repeated roadmap items

roadmapItems = [...] also appears several times.

This should be placed in a single data file, not repeated in your component.

4. Repeated installCommands object

You have:

const installCommands = {
 npm: "...",
 yarn: "...",
 pnpm: "...",
 bun: "..."
}


This also appears multiple times.
Keep one copy, ideally in a data/installCommands.ts file.

5. Duplicated <section id="home"> blocks

There are multiple instances of:

<section id="home" className="min-h-screen ...">


This should exist once only, at the top.
Duplicates will break scrolling and anchor links.

6. Duplicated Trust Badges / GitHub Stars block

The block:

<motion.div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-3 mb-8">
 <a href="https://github.com/cortexlinux/cortex" ...


is repeated several times.
Keep one version.

7. Repetition due to AI tool loops

It looks like the Replit Agent duplicated large chunks of the JSX while editing.

Anything repeated within the same file (sections, arrays, UI blocks) should be deleted.

⚠️ SECTIONS THAT MAY BE USELESS OR OVERLOADED
8. Too many subsections added recently (pricing, sponsorship, developer issues)

You added:

Pricing section

Sponsorship section

Developer bounties section

GitHub issues feed

These are ALL good but stacked together, they create:

✔️ Too much scrolling
✔️ Too much information
✔️ Section fatigue
✔️ Reduced clarity of the core message

💡 Recommended:
Move sponsorship + developer opportunities + GitHub issues into a dedicated /community page.
Keep pricing on homepage if you want conversions.

9. Heavy gradient glows everywhere

Your homepage currently loads:

gradient-glow at top-left

gradient-glow at bottom-right

glass-card on almost all elements

Section-based glows

Background noise texture

This is visually beautiful but also:
➡️ GPU heavy
➡️ Overused
➡️ Causes repetition

💡 Use glows sparingly—maybe only in hero + CTA.

✨ RECOMMENDED CLEAN STRUCTURE (NO REPETITION)

You should aim to keep the homepage structured like this:

1. Hero Section

– Gradient glow
– H1 + Subtext
– GitHub stars / trust badges
– Install command

2. Core Features (4 cards)

– Security
– Deploy anywhere
– Extend without limits
– Get started fast

3. AI Processing Visualization

– INPUT → PROCESS → CORTEX AI → EXECUTE → OUTPUT animation

4. How Cortex Is Different (comparison table)

– Simple
– Clean
– No extra clutter

5. Pricing

– Community Edition
– Enterprise Edition

6. Footer

Minimal.
