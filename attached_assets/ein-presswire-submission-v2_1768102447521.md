## BODY (Paste below into EIN)

SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA — AI Venture Holdings LLC today announced the Cortex Linux Hackathon 2026, a global competition inviting developers to build the future of AI-powered Linux system administration. The hackathon launches February 17, 2026, with cash prizes and rewards announced on launch day.

Cortex Linux is an open-source, AI-native Linux distribution that translates natural language commands into system operations. Instead of memorizing complex terminal syntax, users describe what they want in plain English — like "install a secure web server with SSL certificates" — and the Cortex AI package manager handles installation, configuration, and troubleshooting automatically.

"We're building the AI layer for Linux," said Michael J. Morgan, CEO and Founder of AI Venture Holdings LLC. "Enterprise teams spend billions on system administration that AI can streamline. This hackathon invites developers worldwide to help shape what AI-powered infrastructure should become."

TWO-PHASE COMPETITION

Phase 1 (Ideation): Participants submit proposals for new features, enterprise integrations, and technical improvements. Top ideas advance to Phase 2 with cash awards.

Phase 2 (Implementation): Selected teams build their proposals as working code via GitHub pull requests. Winning implementations become part of the core Cortex Linux platform.

CAREER VALUE FOR PARTICIPANTS

Beyond prizes, participants gain real GitHub contributions to a growing open-source project, official certificates, mentorship from senior developers, and networking with a global developer community.

WHY AI-NATIVE LINUX MATTERS

Linux powers 96% of cloud infrastructure, yet administration remains largely manual. Cortex Linux bridges the gap between knowing what you want and knowing the commands to make it happen. The project targets enterprise IT teams seeking to reduce training costs and human error in system operations.

With provisional patents filed and an Apache 2.0 license, Cortex Linux combines community-driven open-source development with enterprise-ready features.
