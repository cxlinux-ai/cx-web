You are a senior SaaS frontend engineer and product designer with experience shipping enterprise-grade, globally trusted websites.

Your task is to **upgrade the website footer to enterprise standards**. This is **non-negotiable** and must significantly increase perceived legitimacy, legal clarity, and institutional trust.

### Objectives

* Make the footer feel appropriate for a **global, enterprise-facing, open-source platform**
* Add **legal, security, and institutional signals** without clutter
* Match the existing **dark theme, gradients, typography, and premium aesthetic**
* Ensure the footer looks credible to **developers, enterprises, investors, and legal teams**

---

### Required Footer Sections (Must Include)

#### 1. Legal & Policy Links (Left or Center Column)

Add clear, accessible links to:

* **Privacy Policy**
* **Terms of Service**
* **Security**
* **Status**
* **Open Source License (MIT)**

If these pages do not yet exist:

* Create placeholder routes/pages
* Clearly structure them so real content can be added later
* Do NOT remove or hide the links

---

#### 2. Open Source & Transparency Signals

Add a short but powerful transparency line such as:

* “Built in public • Open source on GitHub”
* Link directly to the official GitHub repository

This should subtly reinforce trust, not look like marketing copy.

---

#### 3. Copyright & Legal Ownership

Add a clearly visible but non-intrusive copyright line:

* **© 2025 Cortex Linux. All rights reserved.**

This must be present. This is critical for institutional legitimacy.

---

#### 4. MIT License Visibility

Surface the MIT license properly:

* The “Open Source License” link should clearly reference **MIT**
* Do NOT imply the logo or brand is MIT licensed
* If appropriate, add a small clarification note on the license page that code is MIT licensed while trademarks are excluded

---

### Visual & UX Requirements

* Footer must feel **enterprise-grade**, not startup-casual
* Use:

  * Subtle separators or top border
  * Muted text hierarchy
  * Consistent spacing and alignment
* No flashy animations
* No excessive gradients (subtle is fine)
* Responsive and clean on mobile
* Maintain accessibility (contrast, readable font sizes)

---

### Things You Must NOT Do

* Do NOT add fake claims, numbers, or endorsements
* Do NOT imply partnerships or customers
* Do NOT remove existing useful footer content
* Do NOT break routing or navigation

---

### Final Check

When finished, the footer should:

* Feel appropriate for a **Fortune 500 developer tool**
* Pass a basic legal and compliance sanity check
* Instantly increase trust for first-time visitors

Implement this cleanly and professionally.
