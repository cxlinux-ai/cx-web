The Problem: Quantified Impact

💥
Dependency Hell

Package conflicts and broken installations plague Linux users daily.

47
PAIN POINTS IDENTIFIED IN 5,400 DISCORD MESSAGES
⏱️
Time Drain

Developers waste hours debugging package issues instead of building.

2-4 hrs
AVERAGE RECOVERY TIME PER BROKEN INSTALL
💸
No Revenue Model

Open source projects struggle to find sustainable monetization paths.

95%
OF OSS PROJECTS HAVE NO REVENUE STRATEGY
🌍
Market Scale
Affects 30+ million Linux developers globally. Every broken install costs productivity. Every hour debugging is an hour not building. The economic impact runs into billions annually across the ecosystem.

Phase 1: Judging Criteria — Defensible Logic

📊 100-Point Scoring Rubric

Each criterion scored 1-5, multiplied by weight. Three judges per submission, scores averaged.

20
Market Potential
Is there real demand? What's the evidence of market size?

Why 20%: Ideas without demand don't matter. This filters fantasies from opportunities.
20
Clarity & Specificity
Is the idea well-explained? Specific and actionable?

Why 20%: Vague ideas can't be executed. This ensures evaluability at scale.
20
Feasibility
Can it be built with available resources? By small teams?

Why 20%: Brilliant but impossible ideas waste everyone's time. Keeps Phase 2 realistic.
20
Originality
Is it novel? Differentiated from existing solutions?

Why 20%: Me-too ideas don't move the needle. We need differentiation to compete.
20
Alignment
Does it fit Cortex Linux's mission and architecture?

Why 20%: Great ideas for wrong projects don't help us. Ensures strategic coherence.

Phase 2: Code Judging Criteria

📊 100-Point Code Rubric

25
Code Quality
Readability, structure, efficiency, error handling, best practices
Why 25%: Quality code is maintainable code. This ensures we don't inherit tech debt.
25
Completeness
Functionality, feature coverage, edge cases, stability
Why 25%: Partial implementations create more work. We need shippable code.
20
Documentation
README, code comments, API docs, PR description
Why 20%: Undocumented code is unusable code. Critical for onboarding.
15
Test Coverage
Unit tests, integration tests, test quality
Why 15%: Tests prevent regressions. Lower weight acknowledges hackathon time constraints.
15
Architecture
Style guide compliance, patterns, dependency management
Why 15%: Code must integrate with existing system. Prevents merge conflicts.
