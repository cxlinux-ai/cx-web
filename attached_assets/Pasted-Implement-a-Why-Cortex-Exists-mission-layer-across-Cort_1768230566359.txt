Implement a **“Why Cortex Exists” mission layer** across CortexLinux.com, and create a **dedicated Mission page** that clearly explains intent, philosophy, and long-term direction — without marketing fluff.

---

## PART 1 — Homepage Mission Layer

### What to add

Create a short mission statement section placed:

* **Directly below the hero**, or
* **Just before the feature section**

Limit content to **2–3 lines maximum**.

### Copywriting direction

* Clear, declarative, confident
* No hype, no buzzwords
* Present tense, intentional language
* Sounds like a systems decision, not a pitch

**Example tone (do not over-style):**

> *Cortex Linux exists to make AI a first-class system capability — not a plugin, not a workaround.
> It treats intelligence as infrastructure, built directly into the operating system.*

### Psychology (why this works)

* Answers the subconscious question: *“Why does this exist?”*
* Reduces uncertainty and perceived experimental risk
* Positions Cortex as **designed with intent**, not opportunism
* Calm clarity = authority for technical audiences

### UI / UX rules

* Minimal, centered layout
* Slightly muted text color (e.g. gray-300)
* No cards, no borders, no animations
* Plenty of vertical whitespace
* Should feel like a pause, not a feature

## PART 2 — Dedicated “Mission” Page

Create a new page (e.g. `/mission` or `/why-cortex`) that expands on the philosophy behind Cortex Linux.

### Page structure

1. **H1: Clear, intentional headline**

   * Example: “Why Cortex Linux Exists”

2. **Short opening paragraph (2–3 sentences)**

   * Reinforce intent and long-term vision
   * Position Cortex as infrastructure, not tooling

3. **3–4 short sections (H2)**

   * *AI as Infrastructure*
   * *Why Operating Systems Must Change*
   * *Designed for Builders, Not Demos*
   * *Long-Term, Open, Accountable*

Each section should be **concise, explanatory, and technical in tone** — not sales-driven.

### Writing constraints

* No marketing clichés
* No emojis
* No exaggerated claims
* Explain *why decisions were made*, not just *what exists*

### UI / Design

* Single-column layout
* Generous spacing
* Max-width reading container
* No illustrations required
* Optional subtle divider lines only

### SEO & Semantics

* Semantic HTML (`<section>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`)
* Meta title & description focused on “AI operating system” and “AI-native Linux”
* Internal links from homepage and footer

## Goal

Create a mission layer that:

* Grounds the project emotionally without emotion
* Signals seriousness to developers, contributors, and press
* Makes Cortex feel **inevitable**, not experimental
* Ages well over years, not weeks

This section should feel like the *philosophical kernel* of the project.
