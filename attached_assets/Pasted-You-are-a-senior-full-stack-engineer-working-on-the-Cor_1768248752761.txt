You are a senior full-stack engineer working on the CortexLinux website.

Your task is to  implement a production-ready Bounty Board page** that displays GitHub issues labeled **"bounty"** from the `cxlinux-ai` GitHub organization. NO DUMMY DATA

### Core Requirements

1. **Data Source**

   * Use GitHub’s **public Search API** (no authentication required):

     ```
     https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=org:cxlinux-ai+label:bounty
     ```
   * Fetch **both open and closed issues**.
   * Each issue represents a bounty.

2. **Displayed Fields**
   For each bounty, display:

   * Title
   * Status (Open / Completed)
   * Author (GitHub username)
   * Repository name
   * Created date
   * Closed date (if applicable)
   * Reward amount (parse from issue body or title if present, e.g. `$200`, `💰 500`)
   * Link to the GitHub issue

4. **Caching Strategy (CRITICAL)**
   GitHub limits unauthenticated requests to **60/hour**.

   * Implement **server-side caching**
   * Cache results for **5 minutes**
   * All users should receive cached results during that window
   * Only refresh data after cache expiration

   Explain:

   * Why server-side caching is preferred over client-side
   * How the cache prevents API rate-limit issues
   * How to safely invalidate and refresh cache

5. **SEO & Performance**

   * Server-side data fetching (for SEO)
   * Page must be crawlable by search engines
   * Use semantic HTML
   * Fast initial load
   * No client-only dependency for core content

6. **Reliability**

   * Graceful handling of:

     * GitHub downtime
     * Rate-limit responses
     * Malformed API data
   * Do not crash the page under any condition

7. **Architecture Expectations**

   * Clear separation between:

     * Data fetching
     * Caching logic
     * UI rendering
   * Code should be readable, maintainable, and scalable
   * Add comments explaining key decisions

### Deliverables

* High-level architecture explanation
* Pseudocode or real implementation (TypeScript preferred)
* Explanation of caching logic
* Explanation of rate-limit protection
* Explanation of SEO benefits
* Optional future improvements (auth, user claims, auto-payouts)

Important:

* Do NOT include marketing language
* Focus on engineering correctness, scalability, and reliability
* Assume real traffic and real contributors
