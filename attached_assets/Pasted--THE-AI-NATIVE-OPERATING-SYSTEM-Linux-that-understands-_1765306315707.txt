Tired of Fighting Your OS?
47 Stack Overflow tabs to install CUDA

Days wasted on dependency conflicts

"Works on my machine" syndrome

Configuration files in ancient runes

Developers waste 30% of their time fighting the OS instead of building.

Meet Cortex: Your AI System Administrator
Natural Language Commands
Tell Cortex what you need in plain English. It understands intent, not just keywords.

cortex install tensorflow --optimize-gpu
Hardware-Aware Optimization
Automatically detects your GPU, CPU, and memory. Configures software for maximum performance.

Detects NVIDIA RTX 4090 → Installs CUDA 12.3
Self-Healing Configuration
Fixes broken dependencies automatically. Rollback if anything goes wrong. Never repeat errors.

Dependency conflict? Cortex resolves it.
Enterprise-Grade Security
Sandboxed Execution
AI never has direct kernel access. Every command runs in isolated Firejail container.

Preview Before Execute
Review all commands before they run. You approve every system change.

Instant Rollback
Undo any change in seconds. Full system snapshots before major operations.

Complete Audit Logging
Track every command, every change. Full transparency for compliance.

FOR DATA SCIENTISTS
Before:

6 hours installing CUDA + TensorFlow + dependencies across 47 Stack Overflow tabs

With Cortex:

cortex install tensorflow --optimize-gpu (5 minutes)

Time Saved: 5h 55m

FOR DEVOPS ENGINEERS
Before:

4 hours configuring Oracle DB with manual dependency resolution

With Cortex:

cortex setup oracle-23-ai production-ready (4 minutes)

Time Saved: 3h 56m

FOR ML ENGINEERS
Before:

Version conflicts between PyTorch and CUDA, 3 hours debugging

With Cortex:

cortex install pytorch stable --compatible-cuda (automatic resolution)

Time Saved: 3h

FOR STUDENTS
Before:

"Works on my machine" but crashes on professor's system

With Cortex:

Reproducible environments, exact dependency versions

Time Saved: Frustration: Eliminated

What Makes Cortex Different?
Natural Language Control
Tell Cortex what you want in plain English. 'Install Docker for development' - and it handles dependencies, configuration, and security automatically.

Enterprise-Grade Security
Every command runs in isolated environments with AppArmor and Firejail. AI-validated actions prevent mistakes before they happen.

Learns Your Workflow
Cortex remembers your patterns, detects repetitive tasks, and suggests automation. It gets smarter with every interaction.

Smart Package Management
AI wrapper over apt that understands package relationships, resolves conflicts, and suggests optimal installation strategies.

Time-Travel System Recovery
Complete installation history with one-click rollback. Made a mistake? Revert to any previous system state instantly.
