The current hackathon preview card UI is visually weak and hurts credibility. It feels flat, cluttered, and amateurish, which reduces trust, desire, and click-through rate. Your task is to completely redesign this card to a **world-class, premium, conversion-optimized UI**, without breaking any existing functionality.

### Core Objective

Turn the hackathon card into a **high-status, emotionally compelling entry point** that immediately communicates:

* Seriousness
* Innovation
* Professionalism
* Scarcity and opportunity

This card should feel like something used by **Stripe, Linear, Vercel, or OpenAI** — not a hobby project.

### Visual Design Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Reduce Visual Noise**

   * Remove unnecessary borders, heavy outlines, or flat blocks.
   * Use **depth, spacing, and contrast**, not clutter.
   * Fewer elements, more intention.

2. **Premium Card Aesthetic**

   * Use a soft glass / gradient surface (very subtle).
   * Rounded corners (large radius, not sharp).
   * Gentle shadow with depth (no harsh dropshadows).
   * Background must separate clearly from the page.

3. **Hierarchy First**
   The eye should move in this exact order:

   1. Hackathon title
   2. Value proposition (why this matters)
   3. Social proof / urgency signal
   4. Primary CTA

   If the eye jumps randomly, the card failed.

### Copy + Layout Rules

* **Headline:** Short, powerful, confident
  (No fluff. No buzzwords stacked together.)
* **Subheadline:** Explain the value in one sentence max.
* **Badges:** Minimal, calm, informative (date, builders count, status).
* **CTA:** One primary CTA only. Secondary actions must visually defer.

The card must feel **calm but powerful**, not loud.

---

### Motion & Interaction (Subtle, Not Flashy)

* On hover:

  * Slight lift (translateY)
  * Soft glow increase
  * Micro-scale (very subtle)
* CTA hover:

  * Clear affordance
  * Smooth easing
* Click:

  * Fast response
  * No jank
  * No distracting animations

Motion should communicate **confidence and responsiveness**, not excitement spam.

---

### Color & Typography

* Use the existing brand palette, but:

  * Increase contrast where needed
  * Reduce saturation if it feels aggressive
* Typography:

  * Strong headline weight
  * Softer body text
  * Proper line height and spacing
* Do NOT overuse gradients — they must feel intentional.

---

### Psychological Goals

This card must trigger:

* **Authority:** “This is legit”
* **Clarity:** “I instantly understand what this is”
* **Aspiration:** “I want to be part of this”
* **Low friction:** “Clicking feels safe and obvious”

If it feels confusing, noisy, or desperate, redesign again.

---

### Responsiveness (Critical)

* Mobile:

  * Card must feel tall, breathable, thumb-friendly
  * No cramped text
  * CTA always visible without scrolling confusion
* Tablet:

  * Balanced spacing
  * No awkward scaling
* Desktop:

  * Strong presence without overpowering the page

No overflow. No layout jumps. No compressed content.

---

### Constraints

* Do NOT change existing logic, routing, or functionality.
* Do NOT introduce bugs.
* This is a **pure UI/UX + visual hierarchy redesign**.
* If unsure, choose simplicity over complexity.

---

### Final Standard

When finished, ask yourself:

> “Would a senior engineer or founder trust this project after seeing this card?”

If the answer is anything other than **yes**, iterate again.
