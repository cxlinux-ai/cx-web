You are performing a **full, site-wide SEO optimization pass** across **ALL pages of this website**.
This is not a partial update or a quick fix — treat this as a **deep, professional SEO audit and implementation**.

### Mandatory Instructions

* **Use the provided SEO reference file as the single source of truth.**
  Follow it strictly for structure, tone, keyword strategy, and best practices.
* Spend **at least 20 minutes of focused work** on this task.
* Re-check your work **2–3 times per page** before finalizing.
* Do NOT invent SEO rules — apply only what is relevant, useful, and aligned with the provided SEO file.

### Pages & Scope

You must review and optimize **every distinct page**, including but not limited to:

* Homepage
* Hackathon
* Startup / AI Agencies
* Blog & blog post pages
* News & news articles
* Getting Started
* Security
* Privacy / Terms / Legal pages
* Any landing or index pages

No page should be skipped.

### What Must Be Optimized

For **each page**, ensure the following are correct, unique, and meaningful:

#### 1. Metadata

* `<title>`:

  * Unique per page
  * Clear, human-readable, keyword-focused
  * No stuffing, no redundancy
* `<meta name="description">`:

  * Compelling, concise, informative
  * Matches the page’s actual content and intent

#### 2. Headings & Structure

* Exactly **one H1 per page**
* Logical hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
* Headings should describe **real content**, not marketing fluff
* Remove duplicate or misleading headings

#### 3. Content Quality & Intent

* Content must clearly answer:

  * What is this page about?
  * Who is it for?
  * Why does it matter?
* Improve clarity, readability, and semantic relevance
* Remove vague, empty, or repetitive text

#### 4. Keywords & Semantics

* Apply keywords **naturally**, based on page purpose
* Use semantic variations instead of repetition
* Avoid over-optimization or artificial phrasing

#### 5. Internal Linking

* Ensure relevant internal links exist between pages
* Links should be contextual and useful, not forced

#### 6. Technical SEO (Front-End Level)

* Ensure clean, crawlable markup
* Avoid duplicate titles/descriptions
* Verify accessibility-friendly structure where applicable

### Quality Control & Validation

Before finishing:

* Re-read each page as if you were a user AND a search engine
* Confirm no two pages share the same SEO identity
* Ensure changes improve **real usefulness**, not just rankings

### Final Standard

The end result should feel:

* Trustworthy
* Technically serious
* Clear in purpose
* Search-engine friendly **without sacrificing human readability**

If any page feels generic, rushed, or SEO-stuffed — revise it until it doesn’t.

This website should look like it was optimized by a **senior SEO + product expert**, not a template.
