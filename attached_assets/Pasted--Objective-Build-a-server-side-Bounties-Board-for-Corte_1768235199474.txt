**Objective:**
Build a **server-side Bounties Board** for Cortex Linux that dynamically displays GitHub issues labeled `"bounty"` from the `cxlinux-ai` organization. The board must be **fast, cache-aware, and fully interactive**, with a polished dark-themed Tailwind UI.

---

## 1. Backend Requirements

**API Endpoint**

* Route: `/api/bounties` (or `/bounties.json`)
* Fetch **Open** and **Closed** bounties from GitHub:

```text
Open: https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=org:cxlinux-ai+is:issue+is:open+label:bounty
Closed: https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=org:cxlinux-ai+is:issue+is:closed+label:bounty
```

**Caching**

* Store results **in-memory** for 30 minutes
* Serve cached data to all visitors
* Only call GitHub API when cache expires

**Error Handling**

* Handle rate limits (`403`), API downtime, and network errors gracefully
* Return structured error message to frontend with retry instructions

**Data to Extract Per Issue**

* `id`, `number`, `title`, `html_url`, `state` (`open` / `closed`), `created_at`, `closed_at`
* `user.login`, `user.avatar_url`, `user.html_url`
* `labels` (extract bounty amount if present)
* `comments`, `body`

**Tech Stack**

* Node.js + Express **or** Python + Flask (your choice)
* Include **CORS headers** if frontend is separate

---

## 2. Frontend Requirements

**Layout**

* Card-based layout per bounty:

  * **Title** → link to GitHub
  * **Status**: Open / Completed
  * **Author**: username + avatar
  * **Bounty Amount**: extracted from labels
  * **Comment count**
  * **Created / Closed date**
* Responsive grid or list for desktop + mobile

**Interactions**

* **Filter dropdown**: All / Open / Completed
* **Sort dropdown**: Newest / Oldest / Most Active (by comment count)
* **Search bar**: filter by keyword in title or body
* **Loading skeleton** while fetching
* **Error state** with retry button
* **Auto-refresh** data every 30 minutes

**Styling**

* Tailwind CSS, **dark theme**
* Clean, readable card UI
* Hover effects for links/buttons
* Mobile-first responsive design

**Optional Enhancements**

* Highlight newly added bounties
* Badge for “High-value bounty” if label amount > threshold
* Pagination if > 50 bounties

---

## 3. Integration & Flow

1. Frontend calls `/api/bounties`
2. Backend returns cached JSON
3. Frontend renders cards with filter/sort/search functionality
4. Auto-refresh triggers re-fetch and updates cards smoothly

---

## 4. Deliverables

* Backend endpoint with caching + error handling
* Frontend page or component rendering all bounties
* Filter, sort, search, loading, error states
* Tailwind CSS dark theme
* Fully responsive layout
* Optional: GitHub OAuth for user-specific enhancements (not required)

---

**Notes for AI / Developer**

* Focus on **robust caching** to avoid GitHub rate limits
* UX must handle **loading, empty states, and errors gracefully**
* Make the board **interactive, searchable, and visually appealing**
* Ensure **all data points** from GitHub issues are surfaced

---

This prompt is now structured for **direct implementation** — backend + frontend logic, caching, UX states, styling, and GitHub integration are all clearly defined.

---

If you want, I can **also draft a Replit-ready project structure** with:

* Express API + in-memory caching
* React frontend with Tailwind
* Filter/sort/search logic
* Loading/error states
* Auto-refresh

…so you could literally run it on Replit in one go.

Do you want me to do that?
