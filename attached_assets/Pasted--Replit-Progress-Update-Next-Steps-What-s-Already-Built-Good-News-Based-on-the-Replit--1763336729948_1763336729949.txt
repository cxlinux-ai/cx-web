## ✅ What to Tell Replit Agent NOW

**Copy/paste this into Replit chat:**

```
I need to update the landing page with new content based on user research. Keep the existing design system (dark theme, glass-morphism, animations) but update these sections:

CRITICAL UPDATES:

1. ADD NEW SECTION after "How It Works": SECURITY & SAFETY
   - Headline: "Enterprise-Grade Security"
   - Dark panel with 4 features:
     🔒 Sandboxed Execution - "AI never has direct kernel access. Every command runs in isolated Firejail container."
     🔍 Preview Before Execute - "Review all commands before they run. You approve every system change."
     ↩️ Instant Rollback - "Undo any change in seconds. Full system snapshots before major operations."
     📝 Complete Audit Logging - "Track every command, every change. Full transparency for compliance."

2. ADD NEW SECTION: COMPARISON TABLE "How Is Cortex Different?"
   - Table with 4 columns: Feature | Warp/Gemini CLI | Claude Code | Cortex Linux
   - Rows:
     * AI-assisted commands: ✅ | ✅ | ✅
     * Hardware detection: ❌ | ❌ | ✅
     * Dependency resolution: ❌ | ❌ | ✅
     * GPU optimization: ❌ | ❌ | ✅
     * System configuration: ❌ | ❌ | ✅
     * OS-level integration: ❌ | ❌ | ✅
     * Preview commands: ✅ | ✅ | ✅
     * Rollback capability: ❌ | ❌ | ✅

3. REDESIGN "Use Cases" section with before/after format:
   FOR DATA SCIENTISTS:
   ❌ Before: 6 hours installing CUDA + TensorFlow (47 Stack Overflow tabs)
   ✅ With Cortex: cortex install tensorflow --optimize-gpu (5 minutes)
   Time Saved: 5h 55m

   FOR DEVOPS ENGINEERS:
   ❌ Before: 4 hours configuring Oracle DB
   ✅ With Cortex: cortex setup oracle-23-ai production-ready (4 minutes)
   Time Saved: 3h 56m

   FOR ML ENGINEERS:
   ❌ Before: 3 hours debugging PyTorch/CUDA conflicts
   ✅ With Cortex: cortex install pytorch stable --compatible-cuda (automatic)
   Time Saved: 3h

   FOR STUDENTS:
   ❌ Before: "Works on my machine" but crashes elsewhere
   ✅ With Cortex: Reproducible environments, exact versions
   Frustration: Eliminated

4. CREATE NEW PAGE: faq.html
   - Same design system as index.html
   - Hero: "Frequently Asked Questions" + search bar
   - 7 categories with expandable accordion:
     * Security & Safety (5 questions)
     * How It Works (5 questions)
     * Business & Pricing (4 questions)
     * Technical Requirements (4 questions)
     * Use Cases (4 questions)
     * Getting Started (4 questions)
     * Troubleshooting (4 questions)
   - Link FAQ page in navigation

Keep all existing sections and animations. Just add these new sections and create the FAQ page.

Ready?
